\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Does the man at the next table believe\\*
Gabriel's lips are on the trumpet \& the world\\*
About to dissolve in flames?\\*
He looks as if he might, \& he is not alone.

Breakfast at McDonald's---Burger King?\\*
Somewhere off 94, Stark County, North Dakota.\\*
My daughter, lulled by the pre-dawn rain,\\*
Dozed in the car \& now

Is silent with the gravity of a second awakening.\\*
The men by the window are drinking coffee\\*
And speculating on crops \& weather.\\*
They have red hands \& eyes the color

Of sky rippling on ditchwater.\\*
Once or twice they glance at us\\*
As at something obviously out of place\\*
But not important.

Even so, I am glad to sit at the orange table\\*
And eat my yellow \& orange food. Fast food\\*
For the fast life. Within the quarter hour\\*
The highway will swallow us, reddening slightly

As we pursue our route east,\\*
Our after images, in the mind of the Burger King \\*
Regulars, warping \& fading\\*
Like clouds

Or flames.
\end{verse}
