\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
It's never easy to begin.\\*
Even when the first word opens\\*
A new landscape, so vivid the grass

Blades tongue the back of your newly imagined\\*
Lover---even then, mostly silence must follow\\*
The first word.

2.\\*
In winter, the New England landscape\\*
Is spare as a piece of Shaker furniture\\*
Stripped to the essentials of trampled

Cornstalks, blue hills, dirty ice\\*
And the blue-gold sun low\\*
In the white sky.\\*
\hspace{3\vgap} In late afternoon

As we cross the sere fields bordered\\*
By scrub woods, I feel an almost\\*
Medieval fear of night, rising in black coils

From the frozen earth, scaled with stars, its mouth\\*
A perfect black O\\*
Of nothingness.\\*
\hspace{3\vgap} As my sister talks, I watch

The landmarks of the surrounding countryside\\*
Sink into obscurity: hills \& trees\\*
Fit themselves into one another

In a dark jigsaw until all\\*
Is black on black, the simplest\\*
Language, fallen from speech.

3.\\*
An entire continent lay between us\\*
But I crossed it. I left everything I knew\\*
Teetering on the eastern lip of North America

And drove a truck burdened with all\\*
My possessions through the heartland,\\*
Then tracked north \& west, trying to comprehend

The scale, the correspondence between the map's red\\*
Highway \& this colorless route bisecting North\\*
Dakota, snaking through the Badlands

And delivering me to the steel-blue light\\*
At Coeur D'Alene. Still I did not know\\*
What the symbols meant---road sign, moon,

Stark yellow flower\\*
At the rest stop---nor where\\*
I was going, only the name.

4.\\*
It's almost an accident that I came here\\*
And began by leaning in your door\\*
Nervous, unsettled, ready to fly

Back east, ready to cry\\*
Out that I was fine, fine, I was well-\\*
Adjusted \& settling in just fine.

Fine.\\*
 \qquad And so I've relied on silences,\\*
Mostly, to do my talking, or I've erred\\*
Like the Pilgrim in the morality tracts,

And wandered down oblique paths\\*
Into tangled sloughs or across impossible\\*
Ranges, stumbling into view, finally,

With thorns in my hair, or broken wings crossed\\*
Beneath my jacket like some hybrid\\*
Mythological being trying to gesture

Toward a knowledge,\\*
A world,\\*
She has no words for.
