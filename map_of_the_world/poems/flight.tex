\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
North Dakota ochre \& flat at dawn\\*
And the sky a level gunmetal grey,\\*
The steel rim glittery \& distant.

Maybe a beer with dinner. To still\\*
The hurtling landscape, ease into memory the bleak heart\\*
-Land we tore across, trying to outrace the dark

Weather dragging sparks \& thunder\\*
Across the grizzled fields. Plumy black clouds\\*
Gather, break, roll

North behind us---to the west there's flashes\\*
Of soundless lightning: the rearview mirror\\*
Frames them against the mild blue sky

Opening down the road.  It's like watching\\*
TV with the sound off: somewhere\\*
Destruction rains down with biblical

Fury---but not here.
\end{verse}
