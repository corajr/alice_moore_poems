\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
This sadness is ancient, known\\*
Many times, in many guises, before.\\*
Perhaps even the animals \\*
Knew it, knew it before Eden\\*
Told them they were happy \& death\\*
An illusion. What a relief\\*
When the unnamed rivers flooded\\*
When the garden was left untended\\*
And colors rioted \& fruit dropped\\*
Unpicked. Then beneath the shadows\\*
Of flora saffron \& indigo\\*
Snakes lanced their prey.





























2.\\*
The wound in the heart, that too\\*
Almost a release, relieving\\*
Sadness heavy with the weight\\*
Of its own immutability\\*
And its unreadable alphabet:\\*
Phoenician, letters like stick-drawn\\*
Oars \& sails \& waves---or more\\*
Elemental still, the shark's tooth\\*
Cuneiform of the Sumerian\\*
Incised with the precision of certainty\\*
In the tablets \& fallen columns\\*
At Nineveh.





























3.\\*
Mute for black centuries\\*
In the caves at Lascaux, the caves\\*
At Altimira: ibex, caribou, bulls\\*
The brush-maned horse in their anxious\\*
Phalanx at Chauvet--- and in one chamber\\*
The bird-headed man, stiffly dying,\\*
Over him the lowered double crescent\\*
Horns of the bison, also dying, never released\\*
From its knotted motive, its one\\*
Idea: a killing, a death art suspends:\\*
That bird-man has outlived the artist\\*
Has lain for centuries in the sealed caved\\*
Gazing into the darkness from which death\\*
Should come, will never arrive.
