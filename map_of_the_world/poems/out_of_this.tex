\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Where late the last\\*
Birds of summer cried\\*
And sang: those boughs\\*
Are silent now \& night

In black skeins\\*
Wraps the branches.\\*
The leaves darken but the edges \\*
Sharpen, like acanthus freshly carved

On Corinthian capitals: inky foliage\\*
Supports the even darker entablature\\*
Of night. In this darkness our hands\\*
And all they hold, all they have

Made, become\\*
Invisible.\\*
                This is a night\\*
Without a moon, unmoored,\\*
Adrift from all the others.

                                         Out of this\\*
Darkness, sirens\\*
Wailing their everyday news:\\*
Someone new is entering\\*
All unexpectedly a life

She thought she could avoid, a life\\*
Not destined to take this form:\\*
The light is red, \& comes in waves\\*
The language that reaches her ears does not

Comprehend her.  Animal warmth\\*
Recedes from the world,\\*
Only\\*
Animal forms remain.
