\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Hours after the gym went dark \& the prom music\\*
Sank to tuneless humming or half-dreamt\\*
Memory, the Neon flamed pink, then hell-white.\\*
By moon-set, a charcoal shell the deer\\*
Step around, wary of its dark heat.  This May

Three white crosses glimmer, sink, then leap\\*
Into the halogen arc of headlights\\*
As they sweep the bend. Beyond, the forest\\*
Is black as the pupil of an eye, \\*
Absorbing all light.

Maybe it's the longing for some\\*
Thing not thing, \& pure, pure\\*
As geometry, the siren song\\*
Of the absolute: the exact\\*
Sine curve of the road

In the austere white shadow\\*
Of moonlight.  The strident\\*
Beat of the music takes the whole car\\*
In its fist.  The speed, whatever it is,\\*
Is not enough, \& arcs upward

But not with a perfection to match\\*
The simplicity of this curve\\*
So inhuman, so beautiful\\*
It seems to rise out of this world.
\end{verse}
