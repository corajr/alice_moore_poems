\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Why is it that visit after visit to this same\\*
Tame beach I pick up handfuls pocketfuls\\*
Of scallop shells?  I have dozens at home\\*
In my desk \& bleaching on the sills---\\*
I've no idea what to do with them. I look at them.\\*
Is it that they bring to mind the features\\*
Of classical Greek temples? The reverse,\\*
I think: the temple details unfold\\*
From the shells.  So that the swell then taper of Doric

Columns as they rise to honor Athena,\\*
Or the scrolled capitals of the Erechtheum or narrow\\*
Pleats of marble korai all derive\\*
From this geometry, scattered whole \& broken,\\*
Up \& down the beach. Here amid tossed\\*
Flotsam, kelp, \& scuffed plastics,\\*
There are always the traces of order, difficult\\*
To perceive, or perhaps nascent: the simplest lines\\*
And curves, gathering to a point\\*
Or radiating in a graceful, arced fan

Away from that point.  And where the actual\\*
Shells end, the lines continue, the idea of them:\\*
Even the fragments carry the idea\\*
Everywhere invisible, everywhere present,\\*
Everywhere sensed. So I pick up the visible\\*
Traces: gravel has worn \& polished them,\\*
Gravity has cast them in my path.\\*
My path on the beach today, this \\*
Moment, just this moment.  And those paths\\*
Gathered to an infinitesimal point, radiate.
