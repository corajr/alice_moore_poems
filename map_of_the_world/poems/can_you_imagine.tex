\PoemTitle{Can You Imagine a Hotel Called the Capri in Montana?}
\label{ch:can_you_imagine}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Sleep clings to me \& I cling to the fragments:}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Each morning the same \& different:\\*
Dawn. Entrance ramps.\\*
Mountains. Fields. Suburbs.\\*
Blue air, cold engine, staticky radio.

No station holds. Each morning the familiar\\*
World stutters from its moorings.  This morning\\*
Sleep clings to me \& I cling to the fragments:\\*
Neon palm trees flickering over gloomy

Cinderblock, constellation of street names\\*
---Wyoming, Granite, Montana---\\*
Promising a singular fate but delivering\\*
The Arco station, an island of fluorescent 

Sterility rending the dreamscape\\*
With unwelcome light.  The attendant\\*
Is an alert woman shaped like her smock.\\*
Tagged: Rosa.

I've no idea who she is but I try\\*
To read the lines shadowing her eyes\\*
And I leave imagining a thousand lives\\*
Because I can't imagine the one

I've glimpsed.  My daughter's face\\*
Is blue in the mountainlight.  Like stone.\\*
I don't know who she is, either.\\*
So off the last arc of the entrance ramp

I floor it \& join the fleeing commuters each\\*
Invisible behind tinted glass, each driving\\*
As fast as fear allows, or compels.\\*
Every glimpse is fleeting.
\end{verse}
