\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Yellow light---light that might fill\\*
The maple tree that shadows my house, that impossibly\\*
Fans a cathedral dome of leaves \& light \& shade

Over the rear two-thirds, \\*
Rising \& falling by fractions of degrees--- \\*
But this light falls across landscapes never shadowed

By cathedrals or maples: it is light filtered\\*
Through leaves, patterns of leaves, trees, forests only\\*
Now imagined, reconstructed, perhaps

Quite realistically.   There is good reason to think\\*
So.  And the animals: like \& unlike the clawed, scaled,\\*
Fanged survivors, their toothy descendants: No

These animals are to us creatures: created,\\*
If argued over, from fossils, knowledge, reason, a sense\\*
Of humor, and guesswork. Then covered with feathers

Or not, painted red or striped like zebras or\\*
Not, voiced like birds or crocodiles or\\*
Demons, but voiced \& placed onto the new

Ancient, unknown, rediscovered, unknowable continents\\*
Where they walked \& we walk, where they\\*
Are feathered, red, striped, \&, above all, 

Warm-blooded.
