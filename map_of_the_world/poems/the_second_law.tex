\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
This robin's egg will never hatch.\\*
It's cracked, though whole--- \\*
Like the blue vault of heaven\\*
In one of Giotto's frescoes.   Cracked,

Delicate,\\*
Unsalvageable---\\*
Radical:\\*
It's the center of my attention:

Could art salvage this broken world?\\*
Restore the unbroken oval?\\*
Reveal its hidden face,\\*
Etruscan, perhaps, \& so simple

It becomes an element, a\\*
Force\\*
Like gravity--- \\*
Or a rune, the radical

Alphabet of existence,\\*
The crosspieces of the deepest\\*
Reality, root\\*
Structure of what is:

The stitching \&\\*
Un-\\*
Stitching\\*
Of spacetime

In the Escherian \\*
Geometry\\*
Of the subatomic\\*
Cosmos.

2.\\*
\vinphantom{The delicate} From this,
The delicate\\*
Scaffolding of the atom.\\*
From this, everything.\\*
So. \qquad Every

Thing, however Euclidean,\\*
Is not a thing,\\*
Is not Euclidean, will not fit\\*
Back into itself, is constant

Only in being constantly unmade:\\*
A foam of unmaking and making\\*
Driven by a core harmonics\\*
Of pure mathematics.

3.\\*
                              Is this cause

For dread? Yeats' artists \& sages\\*
Force the question: will all\\*
Shiver \& crack?  Not just this \\*
Egg, so obviously

Fragile-\\*
But the cracked vault\\*
And everything it is seen to protect:\\*
Giotto's walled cities \& mortals,

The animals with their human eyes,\\*
The screen of vegetation stitched\\*
Leaf by leaf, stem \& bole, blossom\\*
And seed across acres---even 

The chlorophyll and photons\\*
That fire the whole-\\*
Does all run down,\\*
All dissolve, chaos

Yawn\\*
\& \\*
Swallow\\*
All?
\end{verse}
