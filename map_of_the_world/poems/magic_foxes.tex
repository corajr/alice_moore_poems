\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The winter sky is sown with dragon scales:\\*
It is the last day of the year. \qquad  Foxes\\*
Assemble beneath the nettle tree:  they look\\*
Like elfin antelope, with long necks

And flame-pink bodies. \qquad Attendant\\*
Fox-fires hover at their shoulders, pale blue,\\*
Pale orange.  Under chainmail dusk,\\*
More antelope-fox arise in flamy cauls,

Approach across swamps, through \\*
Clumped villages where song and folk-tale\\*
Give form to the phosphorescence rising\\*
From fungi, from the rotten logs scattered

Where a road was to be built---but was\\*
Abandoned.  Under the nettle trees,\\*
\textit{Yenoki}, the foxes gather, under\\*
The soughing sky, at the completion of the year.
\end{verse}
