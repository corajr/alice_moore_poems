\settowidth{\versewidth}{Silvering my hands on the sill, whitening the lawn,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
But the poem---everything---ought to be\\*
Comprehensible, don't you think.\\*
He insisted in yet another question lacking\\*
Its punctuation.   \\*
\hspace{3\vgap} If I step out\\*
Of the extinguished house to find the road\\*
Bright with fog \& the blue sun\\*
Burning through its veil

I now answer, or if, late afternoon, the office\\*
Coughs me out to winter light\\*
Glinting like the bronze of Athena's shield---\\*
A moment's astonishment \\*
\hspace{4\vgap} Flickering\\*
Before the wash of exhaustion drowns me\\*
And unconscious \\*
I sway on the stem

Of someone else's dream,\\*
A kind of death---\\*
\hspace{3\vgap} If\\*
At one or two a.m. I feel beyond feeling\\*
Moonlight

Silvering my hands on the sill, whitening the lawn,\\*
Rippling down the unmown hayfield     \\*
\hspace{4\vgap} Until \\*
It falls against the dark body of the woods---\\*
Then

\hspace{2\vgap} I know something I cannot say\\*
Except in light's own grammar\\*
\hspace{5\vgap} Or its\\*
Approximations, these

Apparitions.
\end{verse}
