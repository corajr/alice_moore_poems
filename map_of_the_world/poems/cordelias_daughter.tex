\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
Even this is a measure of my silence:\\*
That I cross out line after line\\*
Trying to imagine Cordelia

As a child.  She appears, when I compel her,\\*
But the image telescopes:\\*
Grave toddler with hieroglyphic 

Eyes, awkward \& solemn\\*
Adolescent who stands\\*
Still as a cypress by her father's throne.

Yet somehow there is the flicker\\*
Of light about her form, light glancing\\*
Off wings in the basalt forest,

Light sifting, cool as snow, over the grey\\*
Courtiers of her father's court.

2.\\*
And this figure of crystal \& tears---at what point\\*
Was it plucked---molten---from the furnace, nipped \&\\*
Queered by the glass blower's pincers

Into the fairy form? Cooling but still\\*
Incandescent with pain at the core?\\*
Defiant, happy, self-absorbed, my daughter

Builds cities I'll trip over in the dark,\\*
Breaks fairy tales into mosaics that explain\\*
Everything, nothing, whatever she pleases.

Watching her face, grown solemn in the TV's\\*
Blue haze, I cannot imagine\\*
Her heart in the glassblower's vise---

Her heart choking on its own hot blood\\*
Speech strangled until speechlessness\\*
Cools the molten core.
