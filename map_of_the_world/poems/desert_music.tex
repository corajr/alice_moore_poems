\settowidth{\versewidth}{Fire bellowing thunder in the blood-black heavens.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
That expanse of heath\\*
Where Lear's rage \& agony\\*
Is the weather---\\*
 \qquad  \qquad That's my country.

Sometimes it's New England\\*
Darkening under a kind of Puritan\\*
Rage at God's excess.

Now I live in the desert\\*
But all the stories I tell\\*
Are colored by that excess: the green

Shadows of black woods, the flame\\*
Yellow fields humming all summer, heavily\\*
Scented with clover \& goldenrod,

The coal-red eyes of nameless\\*
Creatures caught in headlights\\*
For seconds before the light swerves

Or dies.

2.\\*
And sometimes it's some Other\\*
State of mind, a more obviously mythic\\*
Landscape where the scale's not human

And tears become rain. Forked lightning\\*
Is Lear's speech as God's, tongues of\\*
Fire bellowing thunder in the blood-black heavens.

---All the world's his crucifix, all\\*
Consumed away except the crosspieces\\*
of light \& dark.\\*
 \qquad  \qquad No more

Than this: a stick figure\\*
Vexed by the elements, rendered \\*
Larger than life by his griefs---\\*
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad It's the excess

Once more\\*
That makes visible the hand of God\\*
Sculpting the chiaroscuroed wasteland

And the forked animal\\*
Wailing there, lightning-wracked\\*
Stripped of all

By the naked\\*
Light.
