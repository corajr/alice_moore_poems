\settowidth{\versewidth}{The lizards the pink tongues of flowers}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
It is a desert.\\*
It is a desert, how vast\\*
I do not know. It seems endless, \\*
Yet weightless, \& compact: it fits\\*
In a space about the size of my heart. \\*
Its flora \& fauna are Spartans\\*
Raised to scarcity \& sacrifice.\\*
The flowers have lizard-like spines\\*
The lizards the pink tongues of flowers\\*
And the stones are filled with blood.
\end{verse}
