\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 \qquad  \qquad In the desert\\*
There are no tears. It should be a relief.\\*
But everywhere are scattered

The relics of past lives, fossils\\*
Bleached by the light\\*
Of the Hunter's

Moon.\\*
If I could read\\*
These rocks, striated, etched, the bones

Of Devonian forests,\\*
Primitive amphibians, unimaginable\\*
Ancestors---

 \qquad  \qquad Before inland seas,\\*
Lethal though shallow, froze\\*
Entire species in mineral casts

And swept them under glass:\\*
Dusty museum cases\\*
Where I am forbidden to touch them

Eons after death stilled\\*
Each cell, its perfect\\*
Architecture preserved in silica or iron.

All these silent rooms!  I return\\*
To the desert, to the bones, the tracks\\*
Of some long-extinct reptile, an

Alphabet never gathering into words.\\*
If I could trace the evolution\\*
Of scales into feathers, late Jurassic,





[new stanza]

The keel still too slender for muscled \\*
Flight, yet the bones articulating\\*
In patterns that begin to recall

What we know today---\\*
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad But the grammar's\\*
Obscure, and so the stories

Remain in shadow.\\*
Even so I hear\\*
The silence of predators

Gathering across millennia\\*
The rasp of scissoring incisors a\\*
Whisper in 

Petrified forests, forests\\*
Immersed in reptilian\\*
Light.
