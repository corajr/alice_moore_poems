\PoemTitle{Any Motel, Any Night}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Spilled on the living, the frieze of daughter \& mother}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The glow from the set is always phosphor-white.\\*
I flick off the last light \& at once\\*
The economy room is filled with black shapes\\*
Edged in flickering spectral gray.  Our faces

Are chalky but the awful, tasteful painting\\*
Over the combination bureau-desk\\*
Is sunk in gloom. Much better. Silence\\*
The TV next, \& I can hear the cruising

Eighteen-wheelers on the interstate, night\\*
Closing behind them, velvetting their roar.\\*
But without narration, the mosaic\\*
Fails to cohere: what

Are these pictures meant to mean?\\*
My daughter dozes next to me, stirs, looks\\*
At me as if I am mysterious\\*
But hers.  And always close at hand.

``Bosnia'' the caption reads. There is no voice.\\*
There are bodies: splayed, draped, stilled.  Sometimes\\*
There is blood. Spilled on living room rug\\*
Or by the sled in the snow.

Pooling on the cobbles in the marketplace.\\*
It's all light without sound or meaning,\\*
Spilled on the living, the frieze of daughter \& mother\\*
Asleep before the next day's travails.
\end{verse}
