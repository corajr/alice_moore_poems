\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I remember the pheasant's tail-feathers,\\*
The runic patterns of black \& flecked bronze.\\*
Without searching, we found them

Lost in silver-tasseled grasses at the swamp's edge.\\*
Dusk.\\*
We hovered on the margin of my father's

Realm, the horizon\\*
A crescent of hammered gold-leaf\\*
Crowning dark brows.

The day died as we watched.\\*
Then we ran into the velvety darkness as into\\*
The arms of a lover whose heart

We never understood.  Yes I remember\\*
The frogs flame-green at dusk, the splashed\\*
Graffiti of the stars, thick \& illegible---

And off to the side, Orion in his starry sandals\\*
Striding bright arcs over ink-black water.\\*
In the wake of his silence, turtles

Broke the surface, then sank\\*
A tracery of broken rings\\*
In their wake. . . . How long

Did I watch? I don't remember.\\*
But released from that meditation I ran\\*
Not thinking of the poisonous

Cottonmouths, their serrated \\*
Glide past our ankles, pink\\*
Tongues forked in our

Imagination\\*
Like the mysterious\\*
Body of the Other sex, also imagined

Moving with a newt's wet ease\\*
Beneath our dusty clothes---\\*
I remember but I have trouble speaking

Of that time, of the nights I slipped\\*
From rooms shaken by my father's rage,\\*
Trailing after Orion, trying to match

His silence with my own.
