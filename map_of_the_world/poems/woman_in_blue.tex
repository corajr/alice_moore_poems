\PoemTitle{\textit{Woman in Blue Reading a Letter}}
\label{ch:woman_in_blue}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{In this well-ordered room, and I am inwardly}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Though Vermeer offers the conventional\\*
Emblems of romance, possible\\*
Loss or return as wordless\\*
Clues, the narrative that should compel

Coherence is obscure.\\*
The woman's pale blue jacket drapes\\*
In soft large folds over her rounded belly---\\*
Is this mere fashion?  Or is she---

As appears so obvious to me---\\*
Pregnant?  Married?  Who writes?\\*
Lover?  Husband?  Married sister\\*
Dispensing advice on labor \& midwives?

Her hands grip the letter \& she stands\\*
Absorbed.\\*
\hspace{2\vgap} Sometimes I believe I am\\*
This woman standing still as the furniture\\*
In this well-ordered room, and I am inwardly

As still, entirely absorbed\\*
By words that unfold in my consciousness\\*
Alone.     A perfectly ordinary letter,\\*
As it may be, or

A letter whose message may hang\\*
In the air, may overwrite\\*
Everyday objects for years to come,\\*
May be all I know until my death

Decades hence.\\*
\hspace{3\vgap} But here \& now\\*
On this overcast afternoon mid-century,\\*
My face in profile is opaque as the last\\*
Ivory wedge of moon at the turn

Of the unknown season. 
\end{verse}
