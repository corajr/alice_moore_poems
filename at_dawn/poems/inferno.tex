\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
It has been five years that I have been returning\\
to you---\\
Now, at the mid-point of my life, I have wandered from\\
the path and am lost\\
In the bright dark woods of an ordinary life,\\
everyday\\
Needs and chores, and I am afraid to begin a journey\\
whose contours\\
Trace such unknown territory, may demand labor\\
I can't foresee.\\
Do you carry the secret of my death? My life? My children's, theirs?\\
How dark your house, its\\
Porches and doors too vast to be seen, though\\
stars or fires burn\\
In every window. I must, I cannot enter: I have a husband:\\
I am carrying our child.\\
Can you not step from fire into light? Are you afraid\\
of my terror,\\
My mortal confines, my changing face? I dream of your\\
return, but you\\
Show no joy in my child, my husband, my life. You remain\\
silent \& do not look\\
Me in the face. But I cannot go on like this,\\
frozen like Janus\\
On the grave's portal, where sound \& light pool\\
into nullity, \& beginnings\\
End. But I will attempt---despite your fear---\\
to come to you.\\
Though I must go through Hell to do so.
