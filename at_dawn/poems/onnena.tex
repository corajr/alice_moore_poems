\PoemTitle{On Nena's Drawing}
\label{ch:onnena}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Three eyes, a triangular body, a Mona Lisa}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
My hair, purple flame\\*
Or a crown of thorns, crushing, encircling\\*
My up-tilted brow.\\*
My eyes are empty circles, my arms\\*
Two out-stretched twigs\\*
Reaching all the way to the borders\\*
And holding them back.\\*
You float by my side, an arm\\*
Or an umbilical cord\\*
Moors you; you have\\*
Three eyes, a triangular body, a Mona Lisa\\*
Smile; no legs, no need\\*
For legs: Are you\\*
Unfinished? Flying?\\*
And am I\\*
Your mother?
\end{verse}
