\PoemTitle{Spring Returns}
\label{ch:springreturns}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Stone. \qquad The nurses became white vessels, hovering}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Drowning the delicate days\\
That should have been spring\\
The rain poured, scouring\\
The cobbled streets. \qquad Wet sheets

Snapped \& slapped in the grey\\
Backyards \& the wind wrenched a pot of\\
\hspace*{7\vgap} red\\
Geraniums\\
\hfill from the hospital still, shattered\\
At my mother's feet.

All winter, cancer burgeoned in my\\
Mother's mother's womb, overtook\\
The wasted acres of her body, stone by\\
Stone. \qquad The nurses became white vessels, hovering

At her side, pouring cool water\\
Down her feverish bones. \qquad Droning\\
In her ears, Morpheus spread his feathery dark\\
Wings over her brooding body, her closed eyes,

Until\\
Her daughter's name echoed\\
Beyond meaning, deep\\
In her catacombed dreams.

\ldots When she woke, it was not quite\\
Spring---yet the nurses speckled the hospital lawn\\
Like doves. \qquad Light filled\\
The doorway, her daughter

Stepped out of the light,\\
Washed her mother's face,\\
Her arms, her translucent feet; her mother,\\
Dying, knew---in the season before flowering---

The desire for yellow forsythia, one\\
Vermilion tulip, the sky blue\\
As the Virgin's mantle, as terrible \& clear\\
As her eyes.
