\settowidth{\versewidth}{His lips in a wet kiss dredging me up from sleep.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
As snakes charm their charmers,\\*
He charms women. He gives me bracelets: loops\\*
Of amber, ivory, ruby; abalone\\*
Set in ebony. Ciphers, tails in their mouths,\\*
They encircle nothing: ruby, ivory, amber:

They are his absence, his forgetfulness,\\*
His lips in a wet kiss dredging me up from sleep.\\*
Bracelets to wear--on wrist or ankle?\\*
He barters for my oval face, green eyes,\\*
Red hair: Is he a Phoenician trader, risen

From a drowned city, a lost\\*
Subcontinent? Draped in Tyrrhenian purple, bound\\*
To sail the sheer Mediterranean\\*
And never return? Men barter\\*
For that which they desire, or that which they

Need. His eyes are ivory, his lips\\*
Slur words \& kisses, all ciphers--\\*
Bracelets worn around wrist and ankle:\\*
IsÂ  the glamour in the charming?\\*
Why does he trouble

To charm if he is not charmed?
\end{verse}
