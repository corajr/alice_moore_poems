\settowidth{\versewidth}{And kick, flail, throttle---grow scarlet---}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Weeping\\*
Hat \& scarf askew, one\\*
White kneesock fallen

About your narrow ankle\\*
You stride down the sidewalk\\*
Screaming Bastard! Asshole! I'll kill you!

He is nowhere in sight.\\*
You lunge at the scrawny maple sapling\\*
And kick, flail, throttle---grow scarlet---

Until you begin to frighten\\*
The crowd gathered at the bus stop.\\*
They stare: you don't give a

Shit, you're going to kill him.\\*
You stop crying, press\\*
Your forehead against the cold bark, rock

Forward \& back.\\*
Seething, voice cracking, you begin\\*
To sing.     The man

In the heavily padded\\*
Motorcycle jacket snorts:\\*
They shouldn't let them walk the streets

Like that.   No way.\\*
He spits: why\\*
Should he be afraid

Of you? You wear\\*
Your anger like a wig of snakes:\\*
Bastard! You're going to kill him.
