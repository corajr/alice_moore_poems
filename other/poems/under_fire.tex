\settowidth{\versewidth}{Bind them in a frame, a plot, a story--}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
And where is he?\\*
In some bar\\*
Where it is not quite dark\\*
Nor light\\*
And his eyes glitter\\*
But his mind is dark, his thoughts

A tapestry of shadows.\\*
Where is he\\*
Under Fire\\*
In an alien nation\\*
Becoming a killer, survivor\\*
Blessed \& cursed, he'll tell

The story for the rest of his life:\\*
Compelled to wrench the dead loose\\*
From their moorings in his dreams\\*
Bind them in a frame, a plot, a story--\\*
This story, the story about love--\\*
And death.

Everyone listens\\*
Captivated. But he's driven\\*
Away by the one voice\\*
Sneering in his head, whispering\\*
\textit{Killer}.\\*
\vinphantom{Killer.} Into the deserted street

Two in the morning\\*
Alone---\\*
\vinphantom{Alone---} And the mythic moon,\\*
Following at his heels\\*
Casts moving shadows\\*
Before him.
\end{verse}
