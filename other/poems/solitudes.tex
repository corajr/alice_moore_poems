\PoemTitle{Attic Room}
\label{ch:attic_room}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Older than the murderous kings of Babylon.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I want a house with an attic.\\*
The stairs should be crooked\\*
And the windows pitched

At odd angles.\\*
There will be long slats of light\\*
But under the cornices \& deep

In the corners, darkness\\*
Old as the Euphrates\\*
Older than the murderous kings of Babylon.

No one else will come there,\\*
Not even to bring me tea\\*
Or to remark on the scaled \& scalloped

Flowers in the garden. Over-spilling\\*
Its bounds, just out of my sight.\\*
Some loneliness is absolute.
\end{verse}

\PoemTitle{May}
\label{ch:May}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Is temperate enough? What moment}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Every second is a matter of life\\*
And death---and that is the problem:\\*
Where do I live? What day\\*
Is temperate enough? What moment\\*
Not ferocious, a tiger\\*
Like Blake's, roaring\\*
Answer!
\end{verse}

\PoemTitle{Speech}
\label{ch:speech}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Sparrows in their tweeds}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Sparrows in their tweeds\\*
Cordelia-like say\\*
What they have to say\\*
And then are gone.
