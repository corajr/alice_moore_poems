\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 \qquad Attic Room

I want a house with an attic.\\*
The stairs should be crooked\\*
And the windows pitched

At odd angles.\\*
There will be long slats of light\\*
But under the cornices \& deep

In the corners, darkness\\*
Old as the Euphrates\\*
Older than the murderous kings of Babylon.

No one else will come there,\\*
Not even to bring me tea\\*
Or to remark on the scaled \& scalloped

Flowers in the garden. Over-spilling\\*
Its bounds, just out of my sight.\\*
Some loneliness is absolute.

 \qquad 

                           May

Every second is a matter of life\\*
And death---and that is the problem:\\*
Where do I live? What day\\*
Is temperate enough? What moment\\*
Not ferocious, a tiger\\*
Like Blake's, roaring\\*
Answer!

 \qquad Speech

Sparrows in their tweeds\\*
Cordelia-like say\\*
What they have to say\\*
And then are gone.
