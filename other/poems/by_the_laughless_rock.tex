\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                      In spring, she steps

Out of tunneled Hades, returns\\*
To her mother, the natal embrace\\*
Of earth and sky.     The grey saplings shiver,\\*
Anticipating the annual\\*
Resurgence of sap in their winter veins.   Her mother\\*
Releases the cool ferns from their tightly\\*
Curled dreams; newts wriggle free of the loose mud\\*
At pond's bottom:     tiny clouds of silt\\*
Billow in their wake.  In spring, her lithe

Heart is a salamander, slender and\\*
Amphibious, living on the border\\*
Between terror and flight.     In spring, she slips\\*
From the scaly grip of her chthonic life\\*
Emerges glistening and nimble, listening---\\*
Listening for the voice of her\\*
Nascent lover.     The maple saplings\\*
Bow to the gathering wind,    then lift their arms:\\*
Like a child's scrawl, the curlicues

Of opening leaves feather the supple\\*
Branches.     Persephone steps\\*
Into the living\\*
Field, the filaments of grass\\*
Electrified in the commingling\\*
Of chlorophyll and light.     Persephone\\*
Returns to the meadows\\*
Where she was born, where once she played: no\\*
Longer a girl, her eyes are dark as caves.

Halifax, 16 October 1918

My mother's mother stepped out\\*
Of her street clothes, lay\\*
On the high and narrow bed, counting\\*
The red leaves falling past her window

As the midwife counted the minutes\\*
Between contractions.   France was darkening\\*
On the other side of the earth;\\*
Turning away from her: the blossoming pear

Orchards, her maiden self. Poirier,\\*
Her maiden name, pear tree, anglicized\\*
To Powers. Now her Irish husband curses\\*
The gravity of pears in autumn, swaying

Earthward over grass matted gold.\\*
She cries out she cries\\*
Out Maman!      Framed in the white\\*
Hospital window, the slender maples

Shiver; crowned in red, rattle\\*
Grey knuckles against spangled ribs.    Release\\*
The last leaves in a vivid flush.\\*
Born against the scarlet tide: Dark Rosaleen:

The black-haired daughter, green-eyed,\\*
Upon the sea-foam of her mother's\\*
Thighs plunged into the new\\*
World as it opened, wide

[Title reflects corrected year of my mother's birth. I'm  pretty sure this is the correct year.]

Providence, April 23, 1952

White clouds somersaulting in the blue\\*
Sheer sky; below, the lucent tongues\\*
Of new grass whisper against the\\*
Soles of my mother's shoes.     She walks

Across the hospital lawn, up\\*
The marble stairs overhung\\*
With forsythia.    Inside, the pure\\*
Volumes and white edges of her

Hospital room ruptured\\*
By a spray of forsythia, dis-\\*
Located in a pear-shaped vase.\\*
Beyond, the network of black-topped

Streets all leading to this\\*
Bed, these torn cries, this red-faced squalling\\*
Daughter in the crescent\\*
Of light pooling between her thighs.

On the third morning, my mother stepped\\*
Into her street clothes, whispered\\*
Alice Frances---Mother---\\*
This is our daughter.  The waxen leaves

Of her small lungs, her leaf-\\*
Green eyes, the garland of her new\\*
Life is your name writ\\*
In green flame.
