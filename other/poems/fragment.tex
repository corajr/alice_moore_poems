\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The marigolds erupt raggedy\\*
At the edge of the manicured lawn\\*
Flaming\\*
Enraged--\\*
Tearing up\\*
Consuming\\*
The serene grass, flecked with clover, the\\*
Voiceless sunlight.     No--

I mean: the ocean\\*
Is wild but has been\\*
Momentarily tamed\\*
And grows\\*
Flat as a meadow--\\*
Brims gently at my feet, gently\\*
Dissolves away my footprints,\\*
The puzzled tracings\\*
Of my emptied hand.
