\epigraph{(Sonnet for Robert Connors)\\December 22nd 1970}{}

And if the snow ever laid its daggers\\*
On my cheek; if it ever stung them in unmalicious intent;\\*
If this giant white flower that has fallen\\*
From the sky, ever made me real, ever\\*
Touched my heart, then you have, over and over\\*
Too many times for the brief seconds, the seldom seconds\\*
I have with you, too many times for you to know\\*
Or count, too many times for even each of the stars\\*
To have one: please don't go, please don't leave me\\*
Wordless, weightless, mindless; come just to say,\\*
Just to tell me, my day is bright and my nights\\*
Not lonely; tell me the word the moon had,\\*
Tell me, and then hold me, in your ring-around-Saturn arms\\*
And your sturdy shy grin: your smiles and your words.
\end{verse}
