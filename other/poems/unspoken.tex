\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I want to cover my nakedness\\*
With your nakedness, shelter\\*
Where you yourself are unprotected.\\*
It is a place I will never \\*
Come: You don't know\\*
Who you are, or who I am\\*
Or just how naked and full\\*
Of meaning these words are, these words\\*
You do not, cannot, hear.
\end{verse}
