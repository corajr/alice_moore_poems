\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
The bus is still cold\\*
When it reaches our stop\\*
And dark\qquad the aqueous streets

Empty\qquad the sun\\*
Not yet up.\qquad Rising\\*
We file into the same seats

Every morning\qquad every morning\\*
The bus carries us east\\*
To work.    The familiar route

Unreels\quad scene\\*
By scene\quad in our windows\\*
Framed: elementary

School\quad playing fields\quad corn\\*
Graveyard\quad clover\quad skeletal\\*
Farm buildings submerged

In shadow.

2.\\*
\qquad \qquad \qquad Steel\\*
Arc\qquad \qquad concrete

Pinion\qquad reigned\\*
By tension\qquad bent

Between stone and sky\\*
The bridge

\qquad \qquad Over\\*
Curling black water

Looms.\qquad \qquad Blue\\*
For miles around us\qquad for miles

Around us\qquad boreal\\*
Landscape\qquad pillars

Of Lombardy poplar\qquad sunk\\*
In mountainous\qquad shadow.

\qquad \qquad Grinding\\*
Into low gear\qquad the bus

Accelerates\qquad uphill\qquad pauses\\*
On the crest---

3.\\*
Tapestry of flame, the sky\\*
Ignites: royal purple, cochineal,\\*
Tin-white, gold---the light

Clears our sheathed faces\qquad paralyzes\\*
Time.\qquad The two men\\*
Seated behind me

Stammer into silence.\\*
\hspace{3\vgap} There---\\*
On the mountaintop

Coruscating plumage\\*
Impossible---

4.\\*
Impossible to describe\\*
Afterwards.\\*
\hspace{3\vgap}The bus descends

A ball of fire\\*
Balances on the horizon, breaks\\*
Free---rises, yellow

Disk on the blue sky.\qquad By noon\\*
The two astonished men\\*
Will be unsure of what they've seen---

By evening, each of us will wish\\*
For a handful of tail-feathers---\\*
Souvenir, talisman,

Fire---

To carry home to lovers\\*
And children, or the empty rooms where\\*
Once they were

Or someday they\\*
May be: by such light\\*
We will know them.
