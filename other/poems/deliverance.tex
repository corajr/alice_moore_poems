\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I want to be lucid in my death,\\*
Not like this: crumpled, obliterated,\\*
Pain cramping his face\\*
Until the doctors induce a coma

And his features relax once more,\\*
Though now they are still, so\\*
Still they are almost not his\\*
And he seems already to have departed.

                                     When morphine failed,\\*
Morpheus became his guardian \& deliverer,\\*
Guiding him, step by step, down into the darkness\\*
While over his head could be heard the faint voices,

Whispering, whispering, as if\\*
An inexplicable God might change\\*
His mind: "Thank God he doesn't know, thank\\*
God he feels nothing."

To know nothing, feel nothing, \& not to wake\\*
That is death, even if the heart knocks\\*
In cold fury against the ribs.\\*
When I descend, when I leave this light

Fleshed into leaves, cleaved by night, webbed with the singing\\*
Of someone coming round the corner \\*
For the first time: I want to descend\\*
With my eyes open, see the rocky stairs

Become slippery with darkness,\\*
I want to see death approach, \& watch\\*
The darkness swallow me.\\*
Is it downward to darkness?

Or is there light\\*
Blinking then\\*
Opening\\*
Its one eye

\\*
At our unexpected\\*
Arrival?\\*
At the moment I know, I will\\*
Not be able to say

Just like any supplicant\\*
Before any god,\\*
Blinking\\*
At the god's answer.
\end{verse}
