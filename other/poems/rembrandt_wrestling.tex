\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You must imagine the scene prior to the one depicted:\\*
Jacob belligerent and desperate

Bruised, flushed, sweating\\*
His scarlet robe blackened with earth

Each movement of his massive torso      thick limbs\\*
Grown more drunken and ponderous.     And the stranger

Will not yield a name\\*
Does not speak or grunt

All through the brutal night.\\*
An awkward final thrust---

Jacob hoists the angel upon his loins:\\*
The dusky stranger hooks one pink calf

Behind Jacob---astride, cradle him\\*
While sliding a hand down his thigh.

Jacob averts his face:\\*
This is the moment before the moment

Rembrandt has chosen to frame:\\*
Daybreak:   Jacob's thigh pressed out of joint---the angel's

Wings barely visible, though the light\\*
Is harsh---not the light of dawn

But the light that falls through a high\\*
Narrow window in the Netherlands.
