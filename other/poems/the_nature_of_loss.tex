\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

It has been more than seven years.\\*
For more than seven years I have not been able to contemplate\\*
Your living presence.\quad Your death\\*
So horrified me---\\*
Protracted, mute, debased---\\*
That I have taken precipitous \\*
Flight---\\*
Fled the memory\\*
Fled the knowledge you willed me.\\*
And left you.

You have not returned.\\*
I keep expecting you\\*
In a dream.\\*
Or even, waking, gliding\\*
Up to stand beside me where I pause\\*
In the dark street.\\*
And we will talk and laugh\\*
As we used to do, easily.  The shadow\\*
Of night will lift from the lost houses,\\*
Bleed from the grass\\*
And trees\\*
And everything\\*
Will grow bright with your joy \\*
As I used to grow, at your side\\*
Bright and joyous.
\end{verse}
