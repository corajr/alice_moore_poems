\PoemTitle{What I Meant to Ask You}
\label{ch:what_i_mean_to_ask}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{He loves me?" and before I reply, you burst}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You tell me your dreams\\*
But disguise them\\*
With cigarettes, artfully tilted\\*
Between sharp painted nails.  Behind\\*
Your and you ask me: "Does he\\*
Love me?  Do you think\\*
He loves me?" and before I reply, you burst\\*
Into a wild story about a drunken\\*
Party, ending\\*
In a kiss,\\*
Ending.     This new man--you

Laugh nervously\\*
Into his sun-tanned face, his\\*
Guileless blue eyes.\\*
He kisses you\\*
Once\\*
On your forehead     Once\\*
On your lips--\\*
Then sits on the dock's hacked\\*
Edge, sipping\\*
Coffee, his right arm encircling\\*
Your waist.   The sails\\*
Of your heart\\*
Inflate: you\\*
Flutter \& keep.   He\\*
Watches the ocean, it\\*
Ripples     tickles\\*
His toes, vacillating\\*
Uneasily beneath\\*
His blond\\*
Handsome\\*
Glance.
\end{verse}
