\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I carry this knife, your gift, folded\\*
Against my heart as a child\\*
Is carried in the last months of pregnancy.\\*
Is it dangerous?       You seem uncertain.\\*
To clasp that threat close\\*
To my heart where I can be certain\\*
At least of its presence---that's why\\*
I bear it. And to feel the more keenly\\*
How my heart thunders\\*
Against the sheathed blade,\\*
The child who competes for its blood.
\end{verse}
