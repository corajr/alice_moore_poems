\epigraph{ \ldots \textit{I know that my flesh is made of chemicals and molecules}\ldots .}{}
The sunlight\\*
Catching the\\*
Treetops\\*
In green fire-green

Is a physical\\*
Phenomenon.\quad Also

Physical:\quad the water\\*
Petaling out of itself, over\\*
The dam's\\*
Edge.\quad Physical:\quad the bright\\*
Wall of air, the pond's\\*
Glassy\\*
Surface,    the mirage\\*
Of shadowy\\*
Fish, spark-\\*
Ling\\*
Beneath the surface.

\starbreak

Beneath the lightless eye of the electron microscope:\\*
Stippled shadows, the shifting\\*
Configurations of our atoms.   We orbit\\*
A gleaming nucleus of dreams, whose smallest\\*
Component may not be dissected

From the body of the dream.

\starbreak

Physical:\\*
Phenomenal:

Hands and water-smooth thighs\quad hands\\*
And the eel of the tongue, slithering\\*
From its dark recess to lick\\*
At the body's\\*
Light.\quad Physical:

Hands slivering the phenomenal\\*
Light, hands\\*
Parting the water\\*
So that the body may follow.

Physical: the flow of the body\\*
Into itself, the spill\\*
Of light beyond the contours of the flesh.

Phenomenal:   physical:   the dream, the body\\*
Knitting together their fingers\quad of light \&\\*
Flesh, imagining each other.

\epigraph{\ldots .I know that my flesh is made of chemicals and molecules. I know that what I'm seeing is like a dream\ldots .}{}

Beneath the mirror-\\*
Smooth surface of the dream,\quad sleep-\\*
Less fish gleam, darting

Up\\*
From the river's still\\*
Depths,\quad into\\*
The clear shallows,\quad the light-\\*
Filled pools.\qquad The river\\*
Is luminous

Yet

Is contained\\*
By the riverbank.\quad The\\*
Shimmering\\*
Boundaries\\*
Unfold from the river, following\\*
Its motion, created

In the river's shifting edge.

\starbreak

The momentary construction from a moment's\\*
Vision:\quad the bright wall of my flesh, here, beneath my hand,\\*
Now\\*
Billowing into petals of light.

\starbreak

The molecules of oxygen\\*
Suffuse my\\*
Lungs, are\\*
Diffused\\*
Through each respiring cell\\*
Of my body.\quad I am\\*
A lung, a translucent\\*
Tissue\\*
Dilated with\\*
Blood, flushed\\*
With light.

I know\\*
That my flesh is made of\\*
Flesh, is\\*
A veil cast over a\\*
Veil, is,

Is\\*
Not.

\starbreak

Appearing amid the slivers of light: a\\*
Bird, a black bird, pecking at the flotsam\\*
Eddying in a corner of the concrete\\*
Levee.\qquad Soon

It will see me, up here, watching---

Watching---

And will fly\\*
Away.\qquad There:

Gone.

\epigraph{\ldots . I know that my flesh is made of chemicals and molecules. I know that what I'm seeing is like a dream. I know that consciousness is something totally different but yet in some powerful way connected to this physical/chemical organization\ldots .}{Greg Gillespie}

In the black well of the\\*
Sky,\quad stars

Glitter like the scales\\*
Of vast, dark

Fish, gliding\\*
Spellbound,\quad form-

Ing constellations.\quad Here\\*
I am, here

I go, here\\*
I come.\quad Every dream

Is alchemized from flesh into\\*
Flesh.\quad Flesh itself a dream:

Flickering in the moment, swaying on its stem \&\\*
Dreaming.\quad A trillion

Cells in my body, a trillion\\*
Stars in the sky.

A trillion stems of grass, blades\\*
In my heart, flame-

Green tongues in my throat, searing\\*
My lips closed, turning words to ash.

\hspace{0.45\versewidth} IV

Physical

Phenomenon:\quad this tissue

Of flesh, dreaming\\*
On my luminous\\*
Bones.\quad Physical:

The skin of light, spun\\*
From my own, the skeins\\*
Of grass, weaving emerald\\*
Fire with

Shadow.\quad Physical

The white stones, nestled\\*
Among roots in the warm\\*
Loam.\quad On this earth,

I walk.\quad Through\\*
Air petaling open like\\*
A lover's thighs:\quad absorbing\\*
Me, giving\\*
Birth to me.\quad Shimmering\\*
With my afterimages.\quad Here

Now

I step into the shining\\*
Envelope of my body, the vessel\\*
Spun from clay: silicates \&\\*
Water, thrown on the wheel, raised\\*
Into a cylinder\\*
Whose mouth encircles darkness, opens\\*
To light.\quad Spinning

On the wheel of my self, now,

With each breath petaling in\\*
To myself, opening

With each tug of my lungs at the air.\\*
Physical:

This momentary\\*
Convergence\\*
Of chemicals \& heat, light \&\\*
Water, flesh \& blood-\\*
Filled dreams.\quad Physical:

The revolution of electrons about their\\*
Imaginary\\*
Nuclei.\quad Physical:\quad the imaginary

Here \& now, physical, the nipples\\*
Lips \& hands of this imaginary body,\quad the rip-\\*
Tide of light, the bolting fish caught\\*
In these mercurial\\*
Waters.
