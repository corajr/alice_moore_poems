\settowidth{\versewidth}{In America, you fear for your children.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
After seven months of combat in Vietnam\\*
In America, you fear for your children.\\*
Anything could happen here.\\*
That's the promise.

In Vietnam sometimes, you say,\\*
In every leaf, a bullet hole.\\*
No wild animals in the jungle,\\*
Not even the snakes you had feared.
\end{verse}
