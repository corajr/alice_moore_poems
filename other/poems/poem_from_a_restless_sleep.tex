\epigraph{\textit{(for Barbara H.)}}{}

Her face floats next to mine on the pillow---\\*
A gentle\\*
Full\\*
Moon---

Her direct glance\\*
Has been folded\\*
Into the blanket of sleep.\\*
As she sleeps, she

Talks. I\\*
Like next to her\\*
In the still, white-\\*
Shelter bed, not calm

But paralyzed\\*
By the act of listening\\*
Trying to catch the nuances\\*
Of her blurred speech, the rhythms

Of her slurred, musical questions.\\*
Questions repeated\\*
As if their answers\\*
Were somehow

Hidden\\*
In the dreamy convolutions\\*
Of their phrasing.\qquad Slowly\\*
Dreams boil out of the grey air,

Enveloping us.\\*
Her face wanes from the pillow\\*
And edges in my dream where\\*
I may not

Touch nor\\*
Turn from it: together\\*
We possess\\*
And are possessed by

This suffocated moment, frozen\\*
Outside of time, beyond\\*
Remembrance or commitment.\\*
In the morning

Disconnected images drift\\*
Between us--\\*
In the morning\qquad The\\*
Tender

Voiceless

Morning.
