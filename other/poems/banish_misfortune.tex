\PoemTitle{Banish Misfortune: A Sonnet, A Jig}
\label{ch:banish_misfortune}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{There's still days to open, wine to spill.    Don't fuss}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Consider, friends, loved ones, I may\\*
Die in a year, or two, or three.   The day\\*
Will come: I will see my finest plans unravel\\*
No matter how desired: to write, to love, to travel

To places once loved, or that I dreamed\\*
Of someday finding: the place where crows convene\\*
Dropping to earth in silent gyres at my feet.\\*
Otherwise alone, though friends like a sea

Of shadows gather at the margins of last light.\\*
But I'm not dead yet. Let's do these last years right:\\*
Dance---not die before our time, none of us---\\*
There's still days to open, wine to spill.    Don't fuss

When you see me: laugh at the latest wig.\\*
Defy the grave that yawns for all, and dance that jig.
\end{verse}
