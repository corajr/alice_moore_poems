\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
As we follow our toddling daughters around the park,\\*
We talk about everything that can be talked about:\\*
Life, death, our children, the danger\\*
At the edge of the park where the grass breaks\\*
Into broken earth and glass and stone, a sharp drop\\*
To the lot below.   And we know that a fence\\*
Would set a limit to our fears\\*
On one front at least.   Then we could turn\\*
Our attention to the traffic, or the steep\\*
Stone steps they climb fearlessly and fear\\*
-Less leap from.   We leap\\*
To meet them, and miraculously, ten, twenty\\*
Times in a morning, we do, and they\\*
Not only live, but fly.
\end{verse}
