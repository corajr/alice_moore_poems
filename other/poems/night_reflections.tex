\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Memories like old dories\\*
Piled to rot in the reeds\\*
Some splintering but most

Still whole--yet\\*
She'll probably never remember\\*
When it was--the night-time

Boat trip--a crusty green dinghy\\*
On glassy water\\*
Black as an eye all

Pupil, reflecting lanterns     dimmed\\*
Porchlights     the wavery glow\\*
Filtering through battered screens--

They were visiting Tiny's family\\*
Tracking muddy footprints\\*
On cool linoleum

Under light from an old movie.\\*
This wasn't the visit\\*
When a faceless boy kissed her.

That was a darker place entirely.\\*
No lanterns, and Tiny's angry mother\\*
Bringing light and a shouted

Objection.   But no one caught Tiny\\*
Piloting the rickety boat\\*
Down dark channels

And though she was frightened\\*
Of the dark water, frightened\\*
Of being lost, from the moment

They turned up the shallow canal\\*
To the rented house\\*
She wanted to be lost, not returned,

Kissed, not saved.
