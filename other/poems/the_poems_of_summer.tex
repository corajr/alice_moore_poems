\settowidth{\versewidth}{There it is---the word I cannot leave behind:}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Three words appear too often but\\*
Inevitably, in poem after poem: \\*
``Obscure'' ``fragile'' ``daughter''\\*
\textit{Obscure} from the root, \textit{obscurus:}\\*
``Covered, dark''---the dark cover\\*
Of the unknown, of death. \textit{Fragile?}\\*
Everything is fragile---my life no less\\*
Than my daughter's.

\hspace{4\vgap} \textit{Daughter:}\\*
There it is---the word I cannot leave behind:\\*
I a daughter have born\\*
A daughter.\qquad Now I am\\*
Doubled, obscured, nearer death\\*
Because of her life\\*
More alive.
\end{verse}
