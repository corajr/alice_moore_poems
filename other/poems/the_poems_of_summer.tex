\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Three words appear too often but\\*
Inevitably, in poem after poem: \\*
``Obscure'' ``fragile'' ``daughter''\\*
Obscure from the root, obscurus:\\*
``Covered, dark''---the dark cover\\*
Of the unknown, of death. Fragile?\\*
Everything is fragile---my life no less\\*
Than my daughter's.

                                        Daughter:\\*
There it is---the word I cannot leave behind:\\*
I a daughter have born\\*
A daughter.     Now I am\\*
Doubled, obscured, nearer death\\*
Because of her life\\*
More alive.
\end{verse}
