\settowidth{\versewidth}{But across the street there's almost the usual}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On the last day of summer\\*
Downtown is still as Sunday.\\*
Less than a dozen cars are parked,\\*
Glittering, in the sun-baked lot.\\*
But across the street there's almost the usual\\*
Gathering on the laundromat steps, every\\*
One waiting, expectant, \& so not noticing\\*
The unusual commotion in the alley:

Just turned six, the boy\\*
Tears up the alley---\\*
Pauses---\\*
          Dodges!\\*
               Jumps!\\*
                    Pauses---\\*
Leaps from the cockpit\\*
Of the doomed plane!

Scrambles, brandishing\\*
A red gun, squirts and\\*
Look out!\\*
          A bullet---\\*
               A rocket---\\*
                    He whirls!\\*
Flattens against the graffitied\\*
Wall, pouches, mimes

An explosion---

\ldots And everything stops.

The blues smoke clears, drifts\\*
Over the heads of the group dreaming\\*
Still on the laundromat steps.\\*
He mimes a series of final explosions\\*
Very slowly, with awe-inspiring\\*
Deliberation, watching\\*
Himself, his whole\\*
Body teetering on one

Leg, he enters the\\*
Air \& it

Takes him.
