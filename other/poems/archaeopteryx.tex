\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1. \\*
She imagines a Cretan summer\\*
in New England.  Above her in the raw\\*
morning sky the clouds kaleidoscope:\\*
continents surrounded

by seas glittering with the scales\\*
of mermaids with green\\*
eyes and tails. \qquad  \qquad She tail-\\*
spins from the porch, leaps

to the precipices of air, scattering\\*
clouds of brown grasshoppers\\*
across the scorched lawn. \qquad Tropical

and lush, the colors of her feathers flush\\*
beyond the black outlines crayoned\\*
in scalloped rows. \qquad Chameleon

 \qquad in scaly wings she\\*
 \qquad  wheels and soars\\*
 \qquad    glamorous as\\*
 \qquad         Icarus 

before his plunge into the gaping Aegean.

2.\\*
She snakes out\\*
into the humid summer night.\\*
The window frames her parents and baby sister\\*
gathered in the living room, bathed in the light

of the black and white TV.\\*
The darkness is pinioned to her\\*
like a cape, a wing, a secret\\*
identity. \qquad I

am her moon-fringed shadow trailing\\*
through labyrinthine bushes late\\*
one summer night. \qquad She \\*
does not answer my questions. \qquad  \qquad But

hushes me.  Later\\*
she tents the bedclothes over her head\\*
to protect her from the looming\\*
presences, the draped

shadows of the bedroom.  Their\\*
hair hangs down in silver\\*
streams; their eyes and teeth\\*
glitter like coins or moonlight

in her Daedelean dreams.
