\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                                  I\\*
Perhaps god may explode the bodies of\\*
Angels\\*
              Across the delicate evening sky\\*
                          Leaving only

The rags\\*
              Of their rose-colored robes the\\*
              White \& gold\\*
                                       Snarls

Of hair, the\\*
                    Disintegrating\\*
                                              Light-filled\\*
                                       Fragments

Of their wings\\*
                         Laughter\\*
                                        Small\\*
Feet \& hands.     Perhaps god

May smear\\*
                 Their blood, their\\*
Chanson, the shards\\*
                                  Of their

Fine-featured faces \& moon-\\*
                                               Ridden dreams\\*
Across\\*
        The clear

Evening sky---perhaps\\*
God\\*
        May\\*
Light in the sky's throat

A\\*
Tongue\\*
Of\\*
Fire---

                            II\\*
I have not fire but words: grey\\*
And anxious as pigeons      they

Would consume the flame-blue sky\\*
Crumb by crumb.     And I

Have not the violence nor the angels at my\\*
Command to shatter their clay hearts: with a cry

They rise into the air, formulating\\*
The sky into a shadowed vault: reducing

The fire, tongue by tongue,\\*
To a knot of ash and dung.
