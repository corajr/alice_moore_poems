\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace{0.45\versewidth}I\\*
Perhaps god may explode the bodies of\\*
Angels\\*
\vinphantom{Angels} Across the delicate evening sky\\*
\vinphantom{Angels Across} Leaving only

The rags\\*
\vinphantom{The rags} Of their rose-colored robes the\\*
\vinphantom{The rags} White \& gold\\*
\vinphantom{The rags White \& gold} Snarls

Of hair, the\\*
\vinphantom{Of hair, the} Disintegrating\\*
\vinphantom{Of hair, the Disintegrating} Light-filled\\*
\vinphantom{Of hair, the Disintegrat} Fragments

Of their wings\\*
\vinphantom{Of their wings} Laughter\\*
\vinphantom{Of their wings Laughter} Small\\*
Feet \& hands.\qquad Perhaps god

May smear\\*
\vinphantom{May smear} Their blood, their\\*
\textit{Chanson}, the shards\\*
\vinphantom{\textit{Chanson}, the shards} Of their

Fine-featured faces \& moon-\\*
\vinphantom{Fine-featured faces \& moon-} Ridden dreams\\*
Across\\*
\qquad The clear

Evening sky---perhaps\\*
God\\*
\qquad May\\*
Light in the sky's throat

A\\*
Tongue\\*
Of\\*
Fire---

\hspace{0.45\versewidth}II\\*
I have not fire but words: grey\\*
And anxious as pigeons\qquad they

Would consume the flame-blue sky\\*
Crumb by crumb.\qquad And I

Have not the violence nor the angels at my\\*
Command to shatter their clay hearts: with a cry

They rise into the air, formulating\\*
The sky into a shadowed vault: reducing

The fire, tongue by tongue,\\*
To a knot of ash and dung.
