\settowidth{\versewidth}{Her daughter is dying.  She cannot look away.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
She can't abandon, can't finish\\*
The story: Amid the Black-eyed Susans\\*
Swaying by the thundering interstate,\\*
She held her seven-year-old daughter.

The tractor-trailer tore their car in half.\\*
Her daughter is dying.  She cannot look away.\\*
That face, turned toward hers---\\*
Unfocused, uncomprehending---

Is all she sees, or ever will: her daughter\\*
Sees nothing. Her skin grows cool\\*
With the shock of death, her body\\*
Seems too delicate to hold:

Feathers over matchstick bones\\*
And wings.     Above, the sky\\*
Is crayoned black.  Her daughter, \\*
Now a body, sinks to earth.
\end{verse}
