\PoemTitle{Friday Morning}
\label{ch:friday_morning}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Just after 7 a.m.     I lay in my yellow bed,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I hear the voices of children---\\*
Then the voice of one child---\\*
Then other voices rush over it in a wave.

Where are they?\\*
Near our apartment there are no\\*
Playgrounds---and it is early,

Just after 7 a.m.     I lay in my yellow bed,\\*
Naked, curled into the warmth\\*
Of my sleeping husband, listening

To the children's voices\\*
Intertwined with the calls\\*
Of mockingbird and chickadee and robin.

In three weeks, four weeks, the kaleidoscope\\*
Of maple leaves and watered light\\*
Will rise and fall on the morning

Breeze, spangling\\*
My bare shoulders and flowered\\*
Sheets---There's a hush.   My husband stirs

And clasps me.   The light falls on us\\*
Pure, still, unbroken.    This morning, ten\\*
Mornings before Easter,

The trees are leafless, their grey\\*
Branches dotted with tight buds\\*
And magnifying drops of rain.

Each drop encompasses a tiny sun.\\*
Oh child, child\\*
Unseen, singing


Beneath my window sing\\*
Notes that will shiver\\*
All the droplets down, dropping

Ten thousand tiny suns\\*
On the new grass.
\end{verse}
