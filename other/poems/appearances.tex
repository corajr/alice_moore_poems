\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On occasion, the people I meet resemble you.   The women\\*
Startle me---I see one and think\\*
It's you.   As if you never died.\\*
You simply appear, walking. At the market, turning\\*
The fruits and vegetables over in your hands, examining\\*
Their skins, their living colors.   Walking,\\*
Singing to yourself, walking.\\*
I follow you with my child, teaching her\\*
Your song.

 \qquad  \qquad It's different with the men, \\*
Of course.   Subtler.   Who expects a man\\*
To be your mother? So it has taken me\\*
Longer to see, more effort to trace\\*
The resemblance.   To understand

That it was you walking beside me, or pausing\\*
Before once more leave-taking, and saying ``Nothing\\*
Will stop her.'' I knew it was true\\*
Because you spoke with the wisdom of one who has died. \\*
You spoke from the mouth of the grave.   Or it \\*
Spoke in you.   And my daughter,\\*
Haloed in her own energy and light\\*
Laughed when you spoke.\\*
She knew you, though you appeared to her as a man.
