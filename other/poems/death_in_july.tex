\settowidth{\versewidth}{ \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad You turn away}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Whitened by sea-salt, the road---\\*
Unknown to me---uncoiled toward you.\\*
On my left, the blue\\*
Yellow and orange tourist town yields\\*
To broad shadeless lawns embroidered\\*
With marigolds, deserted manses\\*
Bleached and whitened and held up-\\*
Right by the absent architect's\\*
Desire.\\*
 \qquad On my right, the blue\\*
Diamond, the ocean---its surface\\*
Faceted by light.   Along the beach\\*
A low serpentine wall, white\\*
-washed, following the curves\\*
Of the shore, the parallel curves\\*
Of Route 1-A.   A dark\\*
Man strolls there, tilting\\*
A parasol over a woman draped\\*
Head to foot in white.   Her face\\*
Averted, her eyes hungrily scour\\*
The sea..\\*
 \qquad Dead, dazzling\\*
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad Mother---\\*
Searching the ocean for your son\\*
And daughters drowned in life,\\*
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad You turn away\\*
From the daughter who seeks you\\*
Who whitens with tears\\*
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad And desire\\*
In your absence.
\end{verse}
