\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

He doesn't listen but he'll teach me:\\*
To cradle the butt against my shoulder, \\*
To level the barrel, to sight.     Ferns\\*
Border his woods, edge his shaved lawn.       I

Want to see his range.\\*
Six-three, he worked the railroad five years,\\*
Joined the union, organized.     In\\*
Business for himself---his own

Man now---he displays\\*
A thousand books on teak shelves,\\*
Shelved women---mounted\\*
In glass and metal---sleek

Cars. Guns.   Two automatic rifles,\\*
One oily black, one tan, slope\\*
Against the carved bed, stocks crushing\\*
The thick pile of the Persian

Carpet.    A dozen brass cartridges\\*
Are nestled in a desk drawer.\\*
I want to see how it's done:\\*
He tacks a bullseye to the dead

Pine, strides back across the narrow\\*
Clearing, towards me.      This\\*
Is how to aim, to squeeze\\*
---Not jerk---


The trigger.    But he fires from the hip\\*
Wildly---wide, wide of the mark.\\*
The foliage of the rain-blackened forest\\*
Splays and flies---the echoes sink

Into the spongy green depths.   Rain\\*
Plop-plops explosive\\*
Taps\\*
On the shoulders of his camouflage jacket.
