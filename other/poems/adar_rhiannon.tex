\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 \qquad Night descends---even in summer---\\*
Quickly in these hilltowns.  It's the mountains,

Dividing abruptly day from night.  Driving\\*
Alongside the falling dusk, I feel the gills 

Of my unborn child fanning my blood.  The sky,\\*
Membranous with rain, grows dark.  Thunder breaks

Dinosaur groans on the boulder-strewn mountainside;\\*
The forest heaves in emerald labor.

It's like driving at the bottom of a lake!\\*
Unable to see, I pull over, turn off the engine.

The headlights draw into knots of light and die.\\*
Pagan-green, sea-green, flame-green

Swirl in a dark mass against the windshield,\\*
Whispering.

 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad The rain\\*
Parts with a low hush, falls back.

On the hood, staring back at me, a raven: one-hundred-eighty\\*
Million years and she has not lost

The scales of the archaeopteryx.  My child\\*
Gives a kick against her dark enclosure:

In four months, the feathery body\\*
Will slide forth on a delta of blood.

Black rune, you have no song, only\\*
The single black note.
\end{verse}
