\settowidth{\versewidth}{Her feet glisten, the veins in her ankles are blue.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The forest closes over his head.\\*
He kneels, examines the gnarled body, \\*
Strokes her arms and legs.\\*
She is tangled amid the tangled

Roots of a bronze oak tree, her face\\*
A mask of parchment and bared teeth.\\*
Her hair is tufted moss,\\*
Fairy-emerald. Her eyes are scaled.

Lifting her hand, papery, ringless, he is \\*
Afraid to let go.  But beneath his fingers,\\*
She quickens: the leather \\*
Skin stretched on skull and skeleton

Softens into dusky flesh, her breasts\\*
Fill out, nipples\\*
Harden like pomegranate seeds\\*
Against his palm.  A caul,

Like a filmy shroud, covers her head.\\*
Her feet glisten, the veins in her ankles are blue.\\*
She stands, wobbly, listing in the sway\\*
Of opposing gravities.  The trees

Are not trees.  From the shadows, ten thousand\\*
Serpentine lovers beckon to her;\\*
The pale mushrooms are fragments of corpses.\\*
She angles her webbed face toward her husband,

Fixes her veiled gaze upon him,\\*
Then beyond.  He weeps as he cannot weep,\\*
Waking.  Through the black loam\\*
Hell plucks at her ankles.
