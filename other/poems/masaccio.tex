\PoemTitle{Masaccio's Expulsion}
\label{ch:masaccio}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Plexus convulsed he strangles}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The rendering \\*
Is harsh:

Rent from the garden,\\*
Eve clutches, covers\\*
Breast and crotch,\\*
Head\\*
Thrown back\\*
Eyes sealed\\*
Face thrust toward\\*
Heaven, she treads the earth.

Adam's \\*
Hands close on his face, his\\*
Flesh suddenly\\*
Grey and heavy\\*
Pain weights his forked \\*
Body: solar\\*
Plexus convulsed he strangles\\*
His own cry

It is cold.\\*
The light is cold.\\*
The angel's face\\*
By definition\\*
Not human\\*
Is righteous\\*
Cold\\*
Flame.
\end{verse}
