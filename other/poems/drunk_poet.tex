\settowidth{\versewidth}{               his words in his mouth}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The light has gone out of his eyes\\*
Replaced by cunning\\*
And sorrow.\\*
Not tonight will he speak---\\*
As poet, artist, lover, veteran\\*
Of a thousand wars---\\*
To people's hearts.   His heart\\*
Is ashes,\\*
               his words in his mouth\\*
Ashes, \\*
             all his love\\*
Ashes---\\*
 \qquad And he curses\\*
And weeps, for all the wine\\*
In Christendom won't restore\\*
The sacramental tongue\\*
Of fire.
\end{verse}
