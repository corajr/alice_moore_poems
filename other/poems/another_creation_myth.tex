\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On the first day of summer, in the formless\\*
Pre-dawn hour, I came upon the body\\*
Of a cow, turning to stone amid\\*
The stones and clover of the roadside pasture. She

Had died giving birth to a ruddy calf---\\*
The calf still half-enfolded in the cooling\\*
Tunnels of her body.     Red\\*
As the raw meat in the butcher's glass

Case, the calf had half-way wrestled free\\*
Of her mother's pink entrails---but was caught\\*
Tight in the vise of her black haunches:\\*
It was not yet dawn and both were motion-

Less:  the dew settled on their still forms\\*
Hair by hair. \\*
\vinphantom{Hair by hair.} It is late August now: soon \\*
The summer's burnt visage will be cooled\\*
By longer nights and cold

Rains.  The stalks\\*
Of tasseled

Corn rustle\\*
Like yellow

Taffeta;\\*
Cicadas

Weight the\\*
Air with their

Drowsy hum.\\*
The silken grasses

Breathe as I breathe:\qquad all\\*
The fields sough

To the winds'\\*
Sowing.\qquad The cows eyes,

Before death, circled the same field and\\*
Sky, the same sky new-born every\\*
Day since the first days\\*
Of Genesis.\qquad Her bones

Lie scattered amid the stones of the clover-\\*
Choked pasture, tombed\\*
Only by the grass as it weaves\\*
A seamless nave in the glistening air.
