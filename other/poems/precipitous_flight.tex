\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

We take it for granted that we can fly:\\*
A skin of metal \& tech envelops\\*
Our bodies, pierces the glistening\\*
Troposphere, transcends weather, detail,\\*
Conflict.     Elysian fields reward our every glance.

Yet the thought pursues us:\\*
Mass slaughter, each of us a fiery\\*
Comet cindering out alone     but first\\*
The screams of the like-damned immolate\\*
Our hearts before consciousness blinks

Shut. Terrorized by that image I swear\\*
Never to fly, never to enter\\*
The realm of its origin--

But emergencies compel me to break my vow.
\end{verse}
