\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Monet's figures dissolve in light:\\*
Light obscures them.\\*
Especially the faces: there's almost\\*
Nothing: the eyes a dark stroke, the mouth

Rose---or blue: Wife or son or mistress or second\\*
Wife---they're all the same, all\\*
Insubstantial as light.  Dark \\*
With excessive bright

They disappear.
\end{verse}
