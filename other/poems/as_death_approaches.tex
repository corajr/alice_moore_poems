\PoemTitle{As Death Approaches}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{With pain we wait.  She wastes, drugged, semi-conscious}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
We never dreamed these summer days spent\\*
In suspension between life and death.\\*
Suddenly our daughter's life depends\\*
On things we cannot see.   Motionless\\*
With pain we wait.  She wastes, drugged, semi-conscious\\*
And we are left darkling, all day, each day\\*
As day wanes into night. Vigil---we keep\\*
As we fuse our will to hers, longing\\*
To compel the return to life.  For life\\*
Is always possible, is all \\*
Possibilities, as is death, \\*
Until death. Now we contemplate\\*
Our daughter's life as we always dreamed\\*
Of contemplating our own---in our\\*
Golden years, as death approaches.
\end{verse}
