\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
             Arbroath Abbey

As if blistered by the foaming edge\\*
Of waves collapsing again \& again\\*
On the shoulder of brown rock\\*
The North Sea beats against day

And night: the gravestones in the yard\\*
Hard by the ruined Abbey.  Names, dates,\\*
The last traces of lives structured\\*
Against destruction dissolve

With each rain, the acid of industry\\*
Near or far eating away the grid\\*
Of letters \& numerals that define---\& rule---\\*
Lives always tending toward

Chaos.
\end{verse}
