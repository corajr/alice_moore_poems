\settowidth{\versewidth}{The first flowers unfurled their tiny flags---}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Darkness. The weight of darkness.\\*
The weight of things lost, of loss, of history\\*
And the ruins, the runes

Of everything that has fallen into silence.\\*
The Solenhofen limestone yields\\*
Impress of feather \& bone

Torquing in death, impossible\\*
Flight across centuries of crushing\\*
Silence.\qquad We don't give up.

We articulate\\*
Remains\\*
And devise names which bring forth

Arguments.\quad Is this the first?\\*
Were the muscles sufficient for flight?\\*
Or did it glide

Into oblivion?\\*
And how did it end?\\*
Did the dinosaurs 

Invent flowering plants?\\*
Sheering to ribbons\\*
The thick forests of seed ferns

And slender cordaites\\*
Opening a wasteland that engulfed\\*
Its creators?

In the interstices\\*
The first flowers unfurled their tiny flags---\\*
Blood-colored, flame-colored---

Among the bones of the great herbivores.
\end{verse}
