(inscription on the base of a statue at Smith College)

This statue stands in a dry fountain.\\*
Her lips and eyes are sealed in bronze, her face\\*
Slapped downward away\\*
From mine.     Her hands

Are clearly a dead woman's hands, held\\*
In poses not natural to life.   One\\*
Nestled between her breasts, when-\\*
Like, unseeing.     The other

Seems to support her: in fact\\*
The weight of her body shifts\\*
Back, reviled that hand.   What am I\\*
To make of this statue?   Mercurial

Muscles \& nerves, the silvery flexion\\*
Of motion denied her--     She\\*
Has been created intentionally flawed:\\*
She cannot hold

An acetylene anger in those hands.
\end{verse}
