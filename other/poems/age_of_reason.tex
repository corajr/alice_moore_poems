\settowidth{\versewidth}{But inside the narrow church it was}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I was young\\*
But old enough\\*
To know about death

To number \& contemplate\\*
The circles of Hell\\*
Resonating in the heart

Of the priest's dark\\*
Sermon---it may have been\\*
Bright outside, the spring

Sunlight warming the grey\\*
Stones \& masonry\\*
But inside the narrow church it was

Dark \& cold\\*
And the priest's words\\*
Were dark \& cold \& his voice

Dark \& strangely\\*
Inhuman. ``You will\\*
Die,'' he commands \& I think

``Yes, and Hell\\*
Will swallow me\\*
Whole \& shatter me \& leave

My parents like two basalt statues\\*
Two gargoyles framing\\*
My tomb, not

Even mourning me just\\*
Frightening \\*
The other children

The children who play\\*
On the crayon green grass\\*
The thin topsoil

Veiling Hell\\*
My grave\\*
Hell.''
\end{verse}
