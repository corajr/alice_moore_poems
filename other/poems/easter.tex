\settowidth{\versewidth}{Yawns blue.\qquad I have been up all night watching}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The wine-dark night slowly lifts\\*
From the arc of green lawn outside.\\*
Orion is consumed by light; the black sky

Yawns blue.\qquad I have been up all night watching\\*
The darkness steal across ordinary objects--\\*
I sketch my sisters where they have fallen

Asleep awaiting word from the hospital.\\*
For hour after hour there is no change.\\*
My sisters' faces in their sadness

Impossible. A net of lines cast and\\*
Recast captures their likenesses--\\*
Not their knowledge or sorrow. Caught

In the isolation of a single light\\*
In a dark room, I recall the cry\\*
Of a childhood friend.\qquad Translucent

As the Eucharist, a delicate drawing of mine\\*
Alarmed her.\qquad ``Never---you must never draw\\*
Christ---it is a sin!''
\end{verse}
