\PoemTitle{HUSBAND AND WIFE FREEZE TO DEATH AWAITING 'ALIENS'}
\label{ch:husband_and_wife_freeze}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The whirlwind sky. Is this the fifth or sixth}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Her husband has been silent for the last hour\\*
His face reflecting the great spirals of snow\\*
The whirlwind sky. Is this the fifth or sixth\\*
Or seventh day? she asks, languid with cold\\*
And lack of water.   The car is unheated,\\*
The wind off the mountainside\\*
Eddies loose snow against the windshield\\*
Then dies, revealing a new landscape---\\*
Crystalline and sheer and uniform.

I don't know how many\\*
He replies, wondering if sleep\\*
Will be possible in that alabaster space\\*
Craft, smooth as the forehead of a god.\\*
Are you tired?      They leave behind\\*
Dusty tins, jars, weapons\\*
Stored in the cellar, stacks\\*
Of unpublished prophecies,\\*
And a child---

Grown, married, unbelieving---\\*
Who is at home in the suburbs, watching\\*
TV.   On the silver screen, the alien\\*
Appears wise, his ovoid head\\*
Balanced delicately on foetal body\\*
His scrolled eyes flickering\\*
At our uneven speech.     We stutter,\\*
We don't comprehend.     Everything\\*
Is white        white      roaring---

The world spins, but the heart\\*
Is broken.    I'm so tired.     Is it safe\\*
To sleep, do you think?
\end{verse}
