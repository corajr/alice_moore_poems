\PoemTitle{HUSBAND AND WIFE FREEZE TO DEATH AWAITING `ALIENS'}
\label{ch:husband_and_wife_freeze}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The whirlwind sky. Is this the fifth or sixth}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Her husband has been silent for the last hour\\*
His face reflecting the great spirals of snow\\*
The whirlwind sky. \textit{Is this the fifth or sixth\\*
Or seventh day?} she asks, languid with cold\\*
And lack of water.\qquad The car is unheated,\\*
The wind off the mountainside\\*
Eddies loose snow against the windshield\\*
Then dies, revealing a new landscape---\\*
Crystalline and sheer and uniform.

\textit{I don't know how many}\\*
He replies, wondering if sleep\\*
Will be possible in that alabaster space\\*
Craft, smooth as the forehead of a god.\\*
\textit{Are you tired?}\qquad They leave behind\\*
Dusty tins, jars, weapons\\*
Stored in the cellar, stacks\\*
Of unpublished prophecies,\\*
And a child---

Grown, married, unbelieving---\\*
Who is at home in the suburbs, watching\\*
TV. On the silver screen, the alien\\*
Appears wise, his ovoid head\\*
Balanced delicately on foetal body\\*
His scrolled eyes flickering\\*
At our uneven speech.\qquad We stutter,\\*
We don't comprehend.\qquad Everything\\*
Is white\qquad white\qquad roaring---

The world spins, but the heart\\*
Is broken.\qquad \textit{I'm so tired.\qquad Is it safe\\*
To sleep, do you think?}
\end{verse}
