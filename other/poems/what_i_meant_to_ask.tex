\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\epigraph{\textit{For Tamsin}}{}
You tell me your dreams\\*
But disguise them\\*
With cigarettes, artfully tilted\\*
Between sharp painted nails. Behind

Your hand you ask me: \textit{Does he\\*
Love me? Do you think\\*
He loves me?} and before I reply, you burst\\*
Into a wild story about a drunken

Party, ending\\*
In a kiss,\\*
Ending.\quad This new man---you\\*
Laugh nervously

Into his sun-tanned face, his\\*
Guileless blue eyes.\\*
He kisses you\\*
Once

On your forehead\qquad once\\*
On your lips--\\*
Then sits on the dock's hacked\\*
Edge, sipping

Coffee, his right arm encircling\\*
Your waist.\quad The sails\\*
Of your heart\\*
Inflate: you

Flutter \& keel.\quad He\\*
Watches the ocean, it\\*
Ripples\qquad tickles\\*
His toes, vacillating

Uneasily beneath\\*
His blond\\*
Handsome\\*
Glance.
\end{verse}
