\PoemTitle{Driving Cross Country in the Summer}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{As if cut from slate.   Sunlight}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Minneapolis

Cleansed by thunder \& lightning\\*
Looks cool \& sharp

As if cut from slate.   Sunlight\\*
Flashes from the upper stories\\*
Streets \& traffic are still

Lost in shadow.\\*
But the highway snakes\\*
Bright gold on the margins.

That's where we'll disappear.
\end{verse}
