\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
          Hourglass

A stream of photons\\*
Curbed by gravity\\*
You take form:     Egyptian

Lotus eyes, oval\\*
Face, a body that tells\\*
Time.        You died

When I was ten:  now I\\*
Am a woman and like you\\*
I can't sleep.   Shrouded

In rain, we hold\\*
Hands as we wait, stranded\\*
For the blue and white bus.   The city

Is inscribed:  neon, scribbled\\*
Trees, the runic alphabet\\*
Of weathered brick,

A newspaper\\*
Blown\\*
Against your ankles.

Before we go, tell me:\\*
What is this city, this\\*
Hieroglyphic face?  

I'm a woman,\\*
Like you, I'm not\\*
mortal.

         Downtown, Waiting for Marilyn

Death could be this red truck\\*
Barreling down on me in the rain.\\*
Marilyn appears at my side, sheathed\\*
In light, her mouth a slash

Shaped into a Cupid's bow. \qquad Marilyn\\*
I say \qquad       You're late.\\*
She murmurs---apologies?---and this\\*
Is mysteriously seductive---

Not her tigress-\\*
Like symmetry, not\\*
Her royal gaze summing

Up the truck, the wet\\*
Asphalt, the random\\*
Bits of color and movement---

I am not sure what she has said:

She compels me to imagine---\\*
Imagine!   In the second\\*
Split before the truck hits.

 \qquad Photograph

Bloodless and immortal, there you lie:\\*
To a hair---as you are imagined\\*
And desired.   Each eyelash is curled and raised

Over your iron-blue eyes---like the\\*
Oars of Cleopatra's golden barge,\\*
Raised and lowered in unison.

Flooded with light, from every angle\\*
Marilyn you take form on the light-\\*
Sensitive film, in the photographer's

Eye?    Atropos spun\\*
In a mesh of light:  if\\*
Not visible,

I am nought
