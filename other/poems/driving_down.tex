\settowidth{\versewidth}{An instant--- and everything is gone.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
How close death is---how close!\\*
An instant--- and everything is gone.\\*
The highway, the blur\\*
Of late winter fields, the slant\\*
Of late afternoon light\\*
All goes dark.

Not even darkness.\\*
Not even the comfort of darkness\\*
And silence. No silence. No heat\\*
Or cold.  Cast back\\*
Into the dimensionless geometry\\*
Before time, or gravity, or thought.

But just now death\\*
Hums audibly in my ears as I\\*
Tear down 86, late, late,\\*
Wish time not whir at my heels\\*
A necessary engine driving \\*
Me to death.
\end{verse}
