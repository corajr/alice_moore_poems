\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The snow fell, eclipsing our separate forms: we hesitated---

Ten years have passed: that moment remains\\*
Etched on the zinc plate of a mid-winter dusk.

You have grown larger than life, more beautiful:\\*
Enameled, like a pearl, by layers of memory.

You walk the sky like Orion, stars\\*
In your belt, O hunter.

 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad  \qquad Once you were a boy.

The landscape was snow-laden: intimate,\\*
Obscure.  I imagined you had spread

A giant white flower at my feet.  A flower\\*
That the spring would destroy.   I hesitated.

The snow lay its daggers on my cheeks.
