\PoemTitle{Sonnet}
\label{ch:sonnet}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Where our bodies are a school}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Our bed smells of us,\\*
The light in our room\\*
Falls in patterns we know\\*
And when I dream\\*
In that bed I dream\\*
Of the underwater place\\*
Where our bodies are a school\\*
Of silvery fish, flashing,\\*
Darting, scaled with light,\\*
One zig-zagging\\*
Shimmer shot through\\*
By the single\\*
Shared\\*
Breath.
\end{verse}
