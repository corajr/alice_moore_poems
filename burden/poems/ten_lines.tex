\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Twin of my heart, last light in the treetops,\\*
Dancer in the dark leafy underworld\\*
Where I have lived all my life\\*
At ease if alone, singular, sometimes\\*
Singing under my breath, dreaming, day\\*
Dreaming, but not dreaming this: these\\*
Acrobats \& musicians of kisses, embraces,\\*
The laughter that follows us, the dreams\\*
That wake us, the joy that takes us\\*
Together into this \\*
\vinphantom{Together into this} new world.
\end{verse}
