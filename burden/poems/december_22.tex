\settowidth{\versewidth}{A world with you.  Since then---}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I could not have meant to you\\*
What you meant to me.\\*
When you died, you took\\*
A world with you.  Since then---

The world has not lost \\*
Its fullness: the green\\*
Of spring, red-gold\\*
Of fall have not

Lost their intensity.\\*
If we had been, then neither\\*
My children nor your child\\*
Would be.  We would not hear

Even the echo of their voices \\*
In memory, nor sense\\*
The flit of their ghosts\\*
At the periphery of vision

On a windy, rainy day \\*
Such as this one.\\*
There would have been some\\*
Other child---or children---

And we would not imagine\\*
Our world without them.\\*
But I never thought---never\\*
Imagined that the last

Time I saw you was\\*
The last. My cheeks stung\\*
With cold. Dusk deepened.\\*
I could not speak, my blood

Drummed in my ears,\\*
And I felt, hot\\*
Suddenly in the cold,\\*
A glisten of heat pass

Over my skin, as if\\*
Your hands made me naked.\\*
The sky bled to indigo.\\*
Amid all that snow,

Luminous, we froze, two shadow-\\*
Figures on an urn, each\\*
On the brink of motion.\\*
I tried to offer

The flower---white, pure---\\*
The snow made: an entire \\*
World, blossoming\\*
Out from where we stood

Untouched, never to be\\*
Consummated.\\*
When you left, you took\\*
That world with you.
