\settowidth{\versewidth}{Draws near.  Then: thorns \& sand \& silence.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
She has become used to being, be\\*
-Coming, newly each morning this\\*
Traveler with a leafless heart, level

Gaze.  She weeps at nothing.  Though glad\\*
For shade \& water in their long\\*
Intervals, short duration, she knows

Most oases warps of desert light\\*
Refracted  broken  mosaicked:\\*
A diorama winking \& wavering, green

But empty, \& dissolving when she\\*
Draws near.  Then: thorns \& sand \& silence.\\*
No hanging gardens, no music

Of water over stones, no whispers like rain\\*
On the skin. No murmurs late\\*
Into the night.
\end{verse}
