\settowidth{\versewidth}{Wish to be what you have become, that swallow}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
In the old songs, a lover, lost or discarded,\\*
Wishes to become a bird, sparrow or swallow,\\*
Too light and small to carry the weight\\*
Of regret and loss and yearning

That confine me here.  I would, I do,\\*
Wish to be what you have become, that swallow\\*
Swerving, dipping, receding, field on field,\\*
Into the west, swallowed by the sky

It pierces.    But if you have taken flight,\\*
Then nothing human can follow\\*
And I must be the one left, the one\\*
Who sings, abandoned or lost, and longing

To abandon, in my turn, everything\\*
That stays me here, gravity, and sorrow.
\end{verse}
