\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The world is your grave. You are immured\\*
In its confines, but you are nowhere\\*
To be seen. Where the palings slat the light

Patterns appear, italic shadows\\*
Emphasizing the empty spaces\\*
Where you are, and

Are not. If you were buried,\\*
You have returned: not a ghost, \\*
But a presence.   A heartbeat.

A hum in the sunlight.   \\*
A stream of thought\\*
Lost, not grasped, 

Percolating through the alluvion \\*
Of consciousness.
\end{verse}
