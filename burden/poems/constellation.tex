\settowidth{\versewidth}{At three in the morning the streets are finally cool}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad Orion\\*
Straddles the rooftops.  The steamy night air

Is sweet \\*
With the odor of

Rain that does not \\*
Fall.

At three in the morning the streets are finally cool\\*
And the meditative voice of a solo saxophone

Cascades from an open window high\\*
Above the closed shops. \qquad  \qquad Your touch

Is like the grip of these ashen\\*
Streets

Upon my imagination\\*
Or like

The wash\\*
Of ambient

Moonlight\\*
Upon these deserted park benches.

Orion's \\*
Head

Turns from the horizon\\*
He is

Listening:\\*
Hunter/

Lover/\\*
Myth.
\end{verse}
