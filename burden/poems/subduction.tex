\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Love is the continent between us, love\\*
The ten thousand miles, the untraveled histories, the\\*
Highways left at dusk: Love the night that unravels

Coast to coast, first abandoning me\\*
To this shadowless land, then, hours later,\\*
Closing your eyes. For the world

Is harsh.  Bright \& harsh. Love\\*
The abyss we don't speak of, parts us\\*
And binds us: love gathers our silences

Year after year.  There's no hell like it:\\*
The igneous geology of the heart:\\*
Molten, volcanic, and dark.
\end{verse}
