                                      For peace at heart

Is death necessary?  Must it\\*
Back-light the thickening silhouettes:\\*
My son, eight this fall, his sled, the trees\\*
Slashed like ink strokes against the glimmering hills?

Wait for me, Mom---he cries as the violet\\*
Winter dusk separates us.  I'm \\*
Right here I answer   under the gaze\\*
Of constellations that refuse their names

Spinning in deathless silence\\*
`Round Polaris, under which I am lost\\*
Always.  Still, I am right here, your Polaris\\*
And you charge up the hill toward me

Or toward my voice in the dark\\*
Gaps between trees \& house \& sky.
\end{verse}
