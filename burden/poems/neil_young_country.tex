\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Moonlight silvered mower, trash, abandoned\\*
Mirror; old bottles, tools lost in plain view: a still\\*
Life that absorbed an hour's thought when I wandered,

Thoughtless, to the garage at midnight. Sleepless\\*
I concluded in a kitchen chair, tracing Orion's\\*
Seamless descent `til the lawn washed blue in the window

And whatever had been mysterious\\*
Sank back into my heart, closed stone tablets\\*
Across its graven face.

 \qquad  \qquad  \qquad           Years, decades, have passed.

Yet the same girl still traces the stark chiaroscuro\\*
Of everything the moon touches, the landscape,\\*
A face, thrown into extremes of light

And dark.  Mystery\\*
Is a torment.  But Orion tantalizes \\*
Me still, and I watch for him.
\end{verse}
