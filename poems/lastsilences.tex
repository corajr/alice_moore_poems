\settowidth{\versewidth}{Bleeding into the sea untroubled}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Your eyes still green\\
Even in death\\
Green   aquamarine     green

I watched you walk out\\
Walk into the ocean\\
Dressed in white

Then dressed in black\\
Then too distant to tell\\
Green mermaid, mere woman

Across the ocean floor\\
Over your head\\
Still walking

The water filling your ears\\
Silver-green bubbles\\
Rising from your mouth and nose

Black swaddling your ankles\\
Thighs, throat\\
Schools of silver fish

Silver glyphs dart\\
Towards you, away\\
Mermaid, mermaid

Black jeweled tail\\
Folding into darkness\\
Where do you begin

And end?\\
There are your legs\\
Finned and slender

Trans-\\
Lucent  foetus\\
White limbs

Then green\\
Shading to black\\
Bleeding into the sea untroubled

By the desire for oxygen\\
The tides of gravity\\
And love

Or the gravity\\
The desire\\
Of words.  
\end{verse}
