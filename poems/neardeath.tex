\settowidth{\versewidth}{My bridal sandals are made of clay}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.\\*
I float in white swaddling\\
Pure\\
Oxygen\\
Not a saint

Burning\\
Not a saint but a woman\\
Waxen and burning\\
Consumed away from within---

The flames are invisible\\
But everything slowly blackens\\
Out of the blackness rises\\
A jungle \quad Green

Snakes   snakes\\
As thick as infants\\
Transparent monkeys\\
Shimmering on air \quad snakes

Carrying blossoms\\
In glassy jaws\\
Blood-speckled\\
Orchids \quad my lungs

On fire---\\
On fire---\\
A flaming caul\\
Over the faces

Of my live children\\
Still\\
Lost\\
In the jungle's heart.


2.\\*
(By night she's a constellation\\
Glinting over the roiling jungle\\
Or perhaps a satellite\\
On a mortal journey.)

3.\\*
My sandals are bridal sandals\\
My bridal sandals are made of clay\\
Sand\\
Water

Everything\\
Is lurid pink, slowly blackening\\
Except me.  I\\
Burn, I walk---

Not a saint but a\\
Mother---\\
On the graves of my children\\
Burning.
\end{verse}
