\PoemTitle{For Elena}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{As you shed the chrysalis of your infant}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You will not remember any of this:\\
My tiny lover, you will not remember\\
Your first glimpse of my face\\
Or the first touch of my hand\\
Trying to read the Braille of your new\\
And frail and frightening self.

And I fear my own forgetfulness:\\
As you shed the chrysalis of your infant\\
Body, infant self, awaken and walk\\
Away from me and into the new\\
Continents of your own desiring, will I\\
Forget the unquestioning child

Sucking life from my breast?
\end{verse}
