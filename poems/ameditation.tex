\PoemTitle{A Meditation on My Mother's Death}

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Banners dazzling as a thousand kings. A birth.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Twenty-nine years ago, you gave birth to me\\
And heralded my arrival with a flourish:\\
Forsythia across the leafless city.\\
Across Providence you let fly

Banners dazzling as a thousand kings. A birth.\\
You gave the forsythia to me as my flower\\
And it blossoms for me every year.\\
Twenty-nine years ago

You rolled the boulders from my eyes:\\
I looked, at you with your own eyes,\\
Your mother's eyes, your mother's\\
Mother's eyes. \qquad Nothing

Can separate us. Not the hand of God,\\
Falling through the waters of this night,\\
To come between us. It is only a veil.\\
You gave birth to me

Twenty-nine years ago,\\
And I was your first child, a daughter.\\
Now the hand of God\\
Appears for a moment between us.
\end{verse}
