\settowidth{\versewidth}{Do you carry the secret of my death? My life? My children's, theirs?}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
It has been five years that I have been returning\\
\hfill to you---\\
Now, at the mid-point of my life, I have wandered from\\
\hfill the path and am lost\\
In the bright dark woods of an ordinary life,\\
\hfill everyday\\
Needs and chores, and I am afraid to begin a journey\\
\hfill whose contours\\
Trace such unknown territory, may demand labor\\
\hfill I can't foresee.\\
Do you carry the secret of my death? My life? My children's, theirs?\\
\hfill How dark your house, its\\
Porches and doors too vast to be seen, though\\
\hfill stars or fires burn\\
In every window. I must, I cannot enter: I have a husband:\\
\hfill I am carrying our child.\\
Can you not step from fire into light? Are you afraid\\
\hfill of my terror,\\
My mortal confines, my changing face? I dream of your\\
\hfill return, but you\\
Show no joy in my child, my husband, my life. You remain\\
\hfill silent \& do not look\\
Me in the face. But I cannot go on like this,\\
\hfill frozen like Janus\\
On the grave's portal, where sound \& light pool\\
\hfill into nullity, \& beginnings\\
End. But I will attempt---despite your fear---\\
\hfill to come to you.\\
Though I must go through Hell to do so.
