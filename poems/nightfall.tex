\PoemTitle{Nightfall}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Oblivion. \qquad Anxious as newborn parents, your children}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Towards evening\\
Your green eyes grew glassy\\
And you curled, slowly, away from us\\
As if you would recover the foetal privacy of the womb,\\
Its intense concentration \& self-\\
Centeredness, its absolute\\
Oblivion. \qquad Anxious as newborn parents, your children

Hovered around your bed, stroking\\
Your arms \& face, saying your eyes shone\\
With tears, not death. We labored\\
Not to breathe or speak, lest you whisper\\
And we not hear.\\
\hfill Too late,\\
We lingered, late into the night. Below us

In the parking lot where cars\\
Are enameled in moonlight, black \& silver,\\
Wander lost visitors, strangers---the lost\\
Friends, the lost sons, the lost\\
Daughters \& lovers, the small\\
Dark figures which night\\
Obscures.
\end{verse}
