\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1.

Each winter night is a black world\\
Which she is doomed---obscure pilgrim---\\
To wander and retrace---every night, until dawn lifts and reveals

The cold fiery hair of the not-quite-damned\\
Mouthing their silent howls in purgatory.\\
	A second later they are gone.

The dawn is ordinary, gray and blue, still\\
And cold, seemingly planetary.\\
This is when she emerges from shadows, not 

Tormented, not afraid, her familiar and now immortal\\
Face averted, only the crescent of cheek and throat\\
Visible, her bent body blending

With the cool, grey-blue light.\\
\hfill Her daughter,\\
I cannot persuade her to look at me, nor\\
To speak, nor by any sign reveal

Whether she walks in anger or oblivion.\\
Mother, this new child, still a curl of cells\\
Rooted in the red wall of my uterus, if

A daughter will be named\\
For you---\\
\hfill Will your name, uttered amongst the living,\\
Turn your face to me at last?

2.

Toward evening you reappear\\
Now in the kitchen, bustling and substantial,\\
No shadow figure---\\
But when you look at me your naked \\
Face seems masked.

You divert my questions\\
With an answer I had not looked for:\\
I must amputate \\
Your foot. It bears my weight, it appears sound:\\
No, you say, fingering my flesh,

Flesh decays. See these white spots?\\
Mother and nurse, you saw\\
Off, without flinching, my right foot, reconstruct\\
Your daughter in the image\\
Of your crippled husband.

3.

Two nights later I dream\\
---Mother, father, what need?---\\
That he murders me.
