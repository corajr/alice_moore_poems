\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  1.
  
The new intern is frightened\\
Of me, of death, is\\
Frightened of my lizard body\\
And fallen face,\\
My single breast.

Daughters\\
You resemble me\\
But you are vivid and loud and whole.\\
Your flesh still\\
Like a wheatfield, impossible

To blemish or cleave.\\
Nothing\\
Leaves sign of death\\
Upon your magical bodies\\
And those that look upon them

Are nourished by their life\\
And their promise of life\\
Eternal.\\
Yet dressed in uniform white\\
There are nurses by my bed.

They are gentle but attempt\\
No consolation.\\
All night they change\\
The blood-soaked sheets.\\
They know I will die.

2.

Is it possible, a possible\\
Future: some day\\
The hospital itself will fall into ruin?\\
Massive\\
Towering

Hellish black\\
Stone cut in blocks\\
Two arms' span wide, two tall---\\
Sheer and impossible\\
Impassible

A mausoleum\\
An immovable dream---\\
Can I imagine it \\
In ruins?\\
Overrun with fuchsia

Blossoms the size of children\\
Vines grass moss lichen\\
These polished blocks broken\\
Black rubble and bracken, dinosaur\\
Trees, rusting cars and the long scar

-Like lake in blowzy finery\\
Lazily washing, over and over---\\
Over and over\\
The shattered torso,\\
The basalt feet

Of the crazed giant.
