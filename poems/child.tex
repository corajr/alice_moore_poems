\settowidth{\versewidth}{To stand upright on the shore of this moment, rational}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Returning home from a great distance\\
Full of the names I give you\\
Shedding them like skins\\
Translucent, etched with the details\\
Of lashes, pores, nails, prints---\\
The body in its electric mesh\\
Of microscopic geometry, flickering\\
Diatoms, salt water, light\\
All cohering, across millennia, evolving\\
To stand upright on the shore of \textit{this} moment, rational\\
Yet without reason---that body\\
Sings you, dances you.\\
\hspace*{4\vgap} And you run\\
Riot in the garden, fill the world\\
With names, spontaneous\\
Song \& story brightening \\
Your face, vivifying its enigma,\\
Its allure---\\
\hspace*{3\vgap} Even as I sing\\
You to sleep.
\end{verse}
