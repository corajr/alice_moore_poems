\PoemTitle{Child}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{To stand upright on the shore of this moment, rational}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Returning home from a great distance\\
Full of the names I give you\\
Shedding them like skins\\
Translucent, etched with the details\\
Of lashes, pores, nails, prints---\\
The body in its electric mesh\\
Of microscopic geometry, flickering\\
Diatoms, salt water, light\\
All cohering, across millennia, evolving\\
To stand upright on the shore of this moment, rational\\
Yet without reason---that body\\
Sings you, dances you.\\
\hfill And you run\\
Riot in the garden, fill the world\\
With names, spontaneous\\
Song \& story brightening \\
Your face, vivifying its enigma,\\
Its allure---\\
\hfill Even as I sing\\
You to sleep.
\end{verse}
