\PoemTitle{Emergency at Birth}
\label{ch:emergency}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Contain that storm, endure those dark dreams stained red}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I didn't recognize you, daughter,\\
Wired and monitored, breath and heartbeat\\
Visible, but not visible\\
The dreams your eyes followed beneath closed lids---\\
Beyond conception, what dreams, newborn?\\
Light and shadow, movement, warmth, hunger,\\
Unshaped by memory or language, unknown---

How can I reach you?  Frail and empty yet full:\\
In you life's terrible energy threatens:\\
The unceasing pulse, the tide\\
Against death is death itself---\\
\hspace*{5\vgap} How can your small body\\
Contain that storm, endure those dark dreams stained red\\
By the womb's or the lid's flesh veiling?
\end{verse}
