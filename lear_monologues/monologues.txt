Lear:
The butterfly shakes off not the crumpled cocoon
Only, but sheds as well the cramped
Form: it fans out the damp folds in its wings,
Which hamper flight, and flies.\qquad That is the lesson

From Nature, that is the natural progression
Of life.  And so I will shed
Crushing ceremony and the cares of state,
Disencumber myself of bruising crown

Too heavy for my neck, with its pigeon’s wobble;
Too heavy for my head, on which even I can see
The blue veins mapped on pink skin.
\hspace*{3\vgap} So I will exchange

Crown and the cares and crosses borne as king
For the remaining years of her kind nursery.
It is fitting that my youngest should usher me
Into the Eden that is Death’s first prefiguring

And arabesque. Thus will I sit in the shadow
Of her garden wall, the world shut out,
My eyes closed, the afternoon heat heavy,
But my forehead cool, my limbs at rest,

My thoughts free.
\hspace*{3\vgap} An elderly king
Whose crown has slipped, an old man
Dozing in the shade of a summer after
Noon.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Invisible to all: none will see
My return to the young man I was, conjured
From memory, desiring all that was before me
Before strife and duty and unmastered passion

Delivered me to old age and its mild pleasures.
Now, one last ceremony, stiff with pomp. Love’s oaths.
The kingdom divided, peace in the garden,
Death. A natural progression.
###
Cordelia:
The rare holy day or feast—or perhaps some
Too hot summer morn the dragonflies,
Darting into the haze, carried off all thought—
I might bring him his ale; seeing him distract’d,

Crown him with daisies, flowers
Simple as a child’s scribble, white and yellow stars
Strung in a loose circlet that soon fell
From brow to breast as the links opened

And his thoughts returned. He was a king,
Subject to his subjects, subject
To his rages. But sometimes
Of a morning, sometimes of an afternoon

The overcast in his eyes withdrew
The storm cleared, I saw that glint
Of blue— and then I approached
Wreathing him with daisies, or with my free

Hand hooking the dangling hawthorn blossoms
To catch us in a sheltering bower, a shelter
Lost in whiplash release when I let go,
And cast my arms about his neck, my arms

Become the garland and my whispers the sweet
Echoes of his own thoughts.   So the linnet
Calls and further down the heath
Another linnet, returning, returns

His call with her own— and so they sing
Carelessly half-echoing, half
Anticipating song with song, a world
It seems, to him, without beginning

And so—it must be—without end.
###
Lear:
Survey my kingdom, map it, parish and pasture,
Shrine and shire, sun-swept lea and field
Bordering forest thick-set with trees as arrows

Jammed in their quivers.  Follow the rivers
To their dark beginnings, and number the fish;
Measure the farms and their meadows, the height

Of the mountains, the weight of their shadows.
Measure, number, weigh: write it
Down—I will divide it with a stroke of my hand.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Give me the map there.
###
Goneril:
Let my promises sound like love—let them

Be his world.  Let him give me all
For a story, a child’s story.    By my life,
Old fools are babes again.
The world his toy, mapped to his pleasure,
And bloated flatteries, blazoning praise
Of Father and Majesty, accepted with childish
Arrogance.  Oh let him,
Like the king in the fairy tale,

Look at the loom, gaze on empty
Shuttle and shaft and swear he sees
What he does not see but should:
A tapestry of plaited stems and blossoms
Framing lion and burning phoenix,
Basilisk and leopard, leopard
Fastened on cringing antelope,
Antelope dying, dying, dying, ever

Approaching death.    A fabled world
Where death and horror are mere
Embroidery: how beautiful
Death appears, imagined, how elaborate
The arabesques that cramp the living
Into coiled design, frozen pattern:
Gorgeous. But death all the same. So.
Let me tell him I see what he

Does not see but pretends to.  He is old,
Not wise, and wishes to shrug off care and live
As the lilies of the field, to crawl,
He says, toward death unburthened.
But he knows not, nor sees, nor cares to see
What it is to crawl, what monsters
Sniff at his tracks, nor what Death—
And I—will demand, ere we yield

Relief.
###
Regan:
When one cannot command, one flatters.
Nothing swells speech like praise: the more
Outlandish, the more stunned and unquestioning
The heart of my frail and foolish father.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Praise diverts
The rational mind: he chases the lovely thought
Like a child tripping after a butterfly—
Not seeing the dark forest it wings towards.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Too late
He stutters in his fury, stamping, stymied
By this smiling daughter turned
Iron-willed mistress of her realm.
###
Cordelia:
O swallow
Perplexing the eye in flight beyond scansion yet
More graceful in plummet and swoop, acrobatic
In wink and flash over the rusting fields
Than merlin or peregrine in their single-
Minded bolt from blazing sky—

O swallow
Lend me your grace
And let my words scour his heart
Till it becomes a hermit’s cell and his own words
Whisper back from the walls. Then

O swallow
Then lend me your grace and your wings
So that once, if once only, I might speak and say nothing
Not shaped by perfect logic made irresistible
By perfect grace. Before the sky, gleaming
Like a thousand scythes, lets loose its birds of prey.
###
Kent:
Eighty winters—some
Without their corresponding summer—
Have crowned him white; when
Did he first look up

And see death in its stuttering
Vulture’s flight, fixing his gaze
With Death’s own
Inflexible eye?\hspace*{3\vgap} He thinks

To yield the crown now
To his daughters & thus rob
Death of the theft?   Still
Even as he sidesteps Death

A king in check
He makes his demands, demands
Attention, demands answers.
\hspace*{3\vgap} But

His youngest stands apart, pale,
A birch in earliest spring,
Budded, not leafed. She’ll not speak—
I know her.

\hspace*{3\vgap} The elder two?
Their oaths
Blister their tongues—
Or should.

Tricked out in their finery
Like the enameled bird
Of Orient myth, they are
As mechanical in their praise,

But like that chiming
Nightingale, too soon
The gears grind, the heart
Seizes, the machine

Clicks and dings its final
Sour note.
\hspace*{3\vgap} What
Could she say, Cordelia, what
Would she have said,

In another world,
In a different room,
Not asked this
Question, a question

Which never should be asked.
###
Regan:
As for Cordelia—
Vestal, immured
In silence as pure as her words

Would be
If she did not worry language
\hspace*{3\vgap} Like a terrier—

She scrapes and gnaws
Meaning down to the
Bones

\hspace*{3\vgap} Till each word is separate
Polished
Glinting in its own light.

But never
Pure enough.  In vain
The struggle: our father hears only the


Rattle of those bones, the
Nothing that so terrifies him
And makes of him a drum for the thunder to pound.

Pitiful
Little King, littler man,
Whittled, forked, stripped

Crashing about the moor
And burning with lightning’s dark
Heat.\qquad He sees all

Only
In its stark
Blue-white

Light—
And learns too late
\hspace*{3\vgap} How dark my darkness is.
###
Edmund:
Language becomes any animal I wish,
Made muscular i’th’heat of my animal
Necessities:

\qquad \qquad I stroke
And it purrs, serves the purpose,
Whatever purpose

Serves me.
I want:

It is enough.
###
The Fool:
Untroubled by the alchemical giddiness of words,
I am Cordelia’s double, her cocky twin, hop-
Scotching, always, just on the far side

Of the King’s rages, king-size, and useless.   Mine
Is the tongue not twisted by a filial
Love as political at the heart as any

Bribe.\qquad I raddle the pale
Figures of speech, I ambush
Expectation, shame polite

Discourse with lies, insults
So outrageous their truth
Stumps rage, staggers reason, halts

Even the imperious, despairing
King in his tracks.\hspace*{3\vgap} You cannot stand
In this world, if you wish to speak

The truth of it.  The one way
To articulate—not divide, not reduce, not
Obscure it—

\hspace*{3\vgap} Is to make clowns of the words,
Fire of the speech
And burn the house down.
###
Cornwall:
You—boy—put aside your beer and beef and gossip.
Your mistress—if that is what you call her—
Will wait.  Prepare my silk robe, my purple gown,
The one trimmed with fur. And you—what’s your name?

To horse and inform—don’t interrupt—
Inform the Earl that we—I and my Regan—
Travel hence with urgency that compels
Defiance of night’s uncertain terrors

And requires of him his immediate—and kind—
Hospitality.   We’ll follow
Almost at your heels. Now go, go, go, go!
I am the Duke!  I will be obeyed!
###
Edmund:
\qquad \qquad Reverend
Father, old man,
You do not go but you should
To the lightless place where the river twists
Over mossy stones: silvery voices rise off
Unseen currents: the voices of sirens, whispering—

Rasping the ear—then drifting across heath
So vast a man there might himself
Lose—till wolves and harpies
Found him.\qquad You should go there
Once, with a deaf army to hold you

Back—you might recognize
Now the trick of tempting
Fools to hear, to believe—
Even when they half-way despise—
What they desire.
###
Goneril and Regan:
\hspace*{3\vgap} But then

It may be you are
That rare man, the one, one

Only, perhaps, who takes their breath
Away.\qquad The rest?

Dull as husbands.
Fools whose spindles

Of bone and flags
Of withered flesh

Even now decay and fade,
Ghastly banners

Amid empty boulders
Where once sirens


Silvery and shimmering in brief
Morning light

Sang.
And lied.
###
Edmund:
With the vengefulness of a minor god
He blinded the gabbling old man
And left him stumbling
In gory darkness.
\qquad \qquad \qquad But the Duke
Did not live to see the old man

Sightless.\hspace*{3\vgap} Gored
In that very moment, he
Was taken by a servant’s just
Quick enough strike.
\qquad \qquad \qquad Unless

Regan herself—would she have
Held this back?—took servant
And ranting husband in single
Efficient thrust?
\qquad \qquad \qquad I must doubt
And turn my thoughts

Elsewhere.
###
Regan:
My husband?
I found him—serviceable. Fiery.
Not like that melancholic and milk-livered
Dull fool my sister has leashed. But—

Just as I might have wished—
A kind of mutinous pity
Turned everything upside down
And set me free.

First the cringing Gloucester pitied
My scarecrow father, lurching about the moor—
So stuffed him in some hovel,
Fed him bread and onions,

And under questioning looked
So pink with guilt I almost laughed.
Then that stupid boy: pale and quaking
Even as he raged with pity!


Pity.  He was slender as a reed,
Hardly bearded. I ran at him behind,
But before that thrust took him,
His one lucky stroke took my lord

And dragged him after into death.
His fire extinguished, mine flared—
And, my most dear Gloucester,
You will find me here,
\qquad \qquad \qquad Smiling

Amid the ashes,
\qquad \qquad Awaiting your coming
My husband.
###
Edgar:
Were I truly mad, how far away
Then the demons of my scorpion griefs—
Then might the monsters of other’s

Fears dog me: whelked &
Whorled, clawed & cloven, leering
Fraternity over church door or bestial

Faces in the smoke of forge or brazier:
All the stuff & nonsense spun
To fright the wicked child.   Naught

Frights that child—or man.   That
Man smiles, leers, calls
Me brother.\qquad Were I truly mad

Then could I leave:
The bad dreams of Bedlam beggars unfold
Beneath infinite skies; the gods

Sprinkle them with stars.   But Edmund—
If he could—would carapace the face
Of infinity, take hammer &

Tongs & burning brand
To anything not cog or gear
In the machine of his will:

No world otherwise
For him.\hspace*{3\vgap} Now

From the long shadows
Cast by dawn I watch

The terrible dark
Engine approach:

Ten thousand men
In iron boots

Ten thousand men
With iron teeth


Churning through fields
Villages\hspace*{3\vgap} the blue

Strangeness of dreams
Nightmares—

The geared toys
Of the man who swears

He is forever free
Of that toy

The human heart.
###
Fool:
Protect us?
From hag & hungry

Goblin? From demons
Smulkin and Fratteretto?

Or from
Skulking brother

Disguised by his
Elders’ too temperate

Imagination:
Were Mad Tom

Truly mad
He would not make

Oaths to defend ye.
The mad

Can’t defend themselves
Let alone

Those who look
To them

For amusement.
###
Cornwall:
\qquad Her glance
Like a blow.

\qquad \qquad Out
Of the darkness

Where
No one

Sees
I see

Through narrowed
Eyes Regan

Glance
At me

\qquad \qquad Then
Away.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Whence this
Blood?

The swirling
Floor

Crashes
Up against

Me: about
Me

Courtiers
Crowd\qquad \qquad hover

Indistinct
\qquad \qquad Like

The shapes of
Winter


Trees
In moonlight.

\qquad \qquad But
Regan—

Regan takes
Too—Too—

Slow the servant—
The boy—

Boy she has long
Regarded

As her creature.
Her

Toy.
But


I?
I

Am no—am
Not her—not

Her—
\qquad Regan!
###
Albany:
How could I not know her? Her own father
Did not know her.  A woman’s shape, a daughter’s
Face, a wife’s deference—though never

Did she yield, not really: too ready
Her “Yes, my lord.”  Performed, not felt.
Smiling, enraged, she grew quiet—

The slightest twitch, only, as a cat’s tail
Before fatal lunge, betraying the fiend
Quivering, sheathed, in her skin.
###
Gloucester:
\hspace*{3\vgap} Too late
I saw their wolfish grins
Flash, I heard them laugh

And mean nothing   or mean
Everything, which amounts to the same
Nothing.
###
Kent:
No, not wolves.   Wolves,
After all, have a kind of nobility:
A clan that knows the winter

Has teeth, and that the world is not
Much kinder, their ferocity
Is, for the most part, not

For each alone, but is
Service to the natural leader,
Their cyning if you like. For

The most part.  But these, these,
Parading on their hind legs,
Are vermin despite their velvet

And crowns.\qquad They slip
From shadows into moonlight
And their hearts are as pale,

And bloodless.
###
Albany:
\hspace*{3\vgap} But when a man
Grins like a wolf,
Or a woman’s eye gleams—

White-green and phosphorescent—
When wolfish cries echo and rise
Out of their hearts, then

The wolves have shed
Their natural skins
And find themselves monstrous

In ours.
###
Lear:
On the moor
In my own Hell
Battered

By a storm of my own making
I curse the booming thunder
Too weak to smother

The relentless whispers
Rising, serpent-like,
From the cracked

Earth of my heart:
Their sweet-slippery
Oaths of devotion

Hiss in my ears, hiss
In my thoughts, hiss
Down my bones in an ice-water burn.
###
Gloucester:
I have passed from light into darkness
From comfort to cold terror
Cast out of my own house
Tearless, for my eyes are blood,

And I am blind.  Once upon a time
I had two sons, both loved alike;
Vassals who served; a king I served;
Untenanted days I let accumulate

—I let pass—without thought.
The indifference of the gods
Seemed benign, like sunlight
Flashing on blossom, face,

And forged steel the same.  Only
This morning they gave me,
Took from me, for the last time,
The world taking shape

In gold light.  Everything
Reappearing just where the gods,
In their play, or their
Indifference, had left it.  But

I was like a little bloated god
Myself, middling indifferent and unblinking,
Unseeing, hardly pausing
To look at what would be gone

By nightfall.    Ah
Even as I glanced, the peregrine world
Fled: I could not hold days,
King, vassals, or sons, and parted

From all I knew, knowing all only
In darkness, blindness, the gods’

Last, most terrible gift.
###
Edmund:
Wishes are for children—
Or women, like the Duke’s smirking
Un-mourning wife, purring like a cat in sunlight
As her sister sweats and glares.\qquad Both wish
To make a meal of me,\qquad and either,
But not both,  may.
Let them sort it out to their pleasure

Or distress.\qquad The while I have other
Business requiring a cool head.
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad That, I say, the Duke
Lacked.  He rushed. For think:

Why not let one eye mock the other?
For an hour? Or a day?
Let the face consider itself, destroyed.
Let the mind contemplate the absolute
Darkness to come.\qquad Why rush the victims
To the dung heap?\qquad Calculate and let the engine
Grind.
\qquad Like a god who watches but who

Does not help and whose smile therefore
Haunts—why not seem to watch
As benignly, smile and coolly
Go about one’s business?  —with neither

More nor less love for the task
Than necessary—and let enemies
—And friends too—make of one what they
Wish.   I will make of mine—and of
The world—
What I
Will.
###
Lear:

\hspace*{3\vgap} Too late
I knew their flattery
Flattery, every sentence over-blossomed,

Roses blown and shameless,
Roses too scarlet, but roses promised
To be mine.\qquad Too late

I knew myself naked

Unadorned    unaccommodated
As any wretch—too late almost
Knew what any and every wretch, on

Moor, in ditch, under storm or night
Feels and knows.   Too foolish
Even for a fool.   Once gold

Now debased; once imperial—
Now pinioned.   Once I charged
Nature herself to render account—

Now I am chastened
Burned down to ash and ember
And hissing flame.
###
Edgar:
Not a king, not a father, barely
The stick figure of a man, banished
To the treeless heath and there

Mazed, stripped, seared by lightning
By hunger hollowed so that his every howl
Shivers my bones, he reviles his daughters:

Wolf, serpent, monster.  Woman. Excrement
In his hair, smeared on pink and white flesh,
All his thought knotted up with

Wrath and revulsion, he has no speech not
Burning with sulphurous oaths.
Worse even than anything his hellish

Daughters could have contrived, it’s a hell
Of his own making and with it he curses
Us all.
###
Edmund:
I will captain Death’s
Grim troops, I will command
The horses, black as iron,
And the brute riders;

I will demand thunder and plague
To wrack and consume my enemies
To confound and silence
My friends.

\qquad In this world—in this
World—there is always
A cause: power.   The world
To be taken.   My desire
To take it.

Yours in the ranks of Death
I say,   and mean all and everyone
In service

To Death.
###
Kent:
The sky opened on pandemonium
With every flash of lightning.

Between bolt and crack
A hairsbreadth, a heartbeat

Of silence—reprieve from damnation—
Then the rumble and crash of the gods

Falling to their deaths as the heavens
Cracked into shrapnel.   Little matter

Those deaths: living or dead, the gods
Have left us.    A cold rain

Washes the stones and rubble.
My sword has become a cross I drag

As I labor through the daimon-haunted world,
The Hell we have forged for ourselves

No god attending.
###
Gloucester:
These holes that were my eyes
Fill with blood.
Shadows that were animals transform
Back into shadows.
One son sinks into animality.
Which one?
###
Edgar:
In the autumn months, he comes
Backward through the night:
From dawn to midnight, midnight
To the watered dark of early
Evening.   Now the forked twig figure—

\hspace*{3\vgap} Orion—
Naked in the winter’s sheer cold—
Is visible in the east, above
The sutured fields, the heath and peat bogs,
Where somewhere my father wanders,

Blind, sure

He is the god’s plaything, the toy
Of their idle wrath.\qquad ‘T is no such thing.
The gods have turned away.
They have eternity
To amuse themselves or feel remorse

Which is to them only
Another seductive amusement.
I must be my father’s new god
Shaping the world beyond
The black shapes of his blindness

Into the possibility
His life’s a miracle
And these arms
Are his son’s
Arms cradling him.
###
Oswald:
Neither my mistress nor her sister
Can see it—but I see it.
He worships a goddess but he loves
No one.
\hspace*{3\vgap} Mistress and sister—each—
Flaunts her contempt for all
That stays ambition, and each
Parades her own ambition as summons

To her caress and kiss, her
Promise of submission if not her
Actual capitulation to his will.
\hspace*{3\vgap} But neither
Captures the mercurial devotion
Of her distracted lover, though each simmers
In the lingering intoxication of his
Lust and heat.
\hspace*{3\vgap} Yes indeed, likely war

‘Twixt duke and duke—but let them
See to the mutinies within the halls,
The machinations masked by silence
When there should be speech, and speech
Merely ritual in its affection.
\hspace*{3\vgap} Servants
Such as myself are the first
To know, the last to speak

—If we speak at all—
When there is trouble in a household.
We watch. I watched the bastard
Son unseat the father,
\hspace*{3\vgap} then smile
His mirthless smile at either sister
As either suited him; waver, whisper,
Caress without noting which

Whispered in return. He rode off
Without either of them, looking
Straight ahead. I took note.  But
So as to look
\hspace*{3\vgap} disinterested, to look
Like a servant, not someone
Who watches them when they forget
To watch me
\hspace*{3\vgap} I disappear and devise

Some chore or task, some
Service to make me seem
Servile, not necessary but
Convenient: unbidden, I bring
A chalice of wine,
I sharpen the ceremonial
Daggers, I feed the Earl’s dogs

When they slobber and beg,
\hspace*{3\vgap} I bide
My time. They forget me
Until they need me. And
—Conveniently—I am there.
The dogs too remember:
They crowd me and whine, sniffing
For meat.  Eying them I think

I’d file my teeth into fangs
If I could.
###
Cordelia:
I watch him burning, flowers in his hair
Pinks, long wilted daisies, and swamp iris,
Their green sabers failing to guard
The purple hearts, inflated chambers

Mashed where the crown should rest, but he
Does not rest, he burns on Ixion’s wheel
Spinning through Hell’s hell, the dark
And empty air of his now dark and

Un-peopled world. Everyone he has known
Transformed or gone. Memories ghosts.
Pitching about the moors, now,
His commands are swallowed by the windy silence.
###
Kent:
Even so. He demands an answer, he demands
An explanation, cracking thunder and the hard
Hearts which crack his own will yield,
He swears, their logic to his logic.
###
Edgar:\hspace*{3\vgap} But logic

Fails. The fabula of the heart dance
On the head of a pin: the learned philosophers
Must either dance with them or shiver through
The night, asking How many, and Why

Dance?
###
Cordelia:
\hspace*{3\vgap} Wash his limbs,
Wash his hands and feet. His face
He has washed with his own tears
Too many times. From his loosening grip

Take the nettles and cowslips, furrow-weed and twig
Forked and of a sudden wondrous—or horrible—
As mandrake root torn screaming
From its native element.  Let his Hell dissolve:

Ghosts, smoke, wisps unraveling
In daylight. Let him waken to music;
Let him waken and not die.
Let him find his daughter, his true

Daughter, for so I am,
I am.
###
Edmund:
There is but one siren, and she sings to me.
Her voice is not silvery and sweet, but low, dark,
Thick with longing; parched with the heat of unsatisfied

Desire. I know her. She is like me. We gull and seduce
Everyone else, like snakes that shed their tight, papery
Skins, leave behind the ghosts of scales and faces

—A horrifying, beautiful distraction—
While we emerge, glistening, vivid, undulant, our
Forked tongues flickering like our lusts made

Incarnate—and still our prey are fascinated
By the beauty that should horrify them,
The beauty they should flee from.

There is but one siren, and her skin is soft as down.
Remorseless, but why should she be other-

Wise?
###
Cordelia:
If, in truth, we become God’s spies,
Where will we watch from?   And what
Will we come to know?\qquad The mystery
Of things is not God’s domain;

Entering the mystery of things,
What must we leave behind?  Will we carry
Our flawed and human hearts
With us?\qquad Or is the heart after all

A gilded cage, disintegrating
As the body decays?   Dust and fear
Dissolving like night’s end
In a fringe of gold as day

Rises to consume darkness and its stars. . . ?

But once untethered, free from the weight of body
And breath—unbound from the wheel
Of day and night, and watching in silence,

Immured in silence:

No matter how many days and nights
Chase each other’s tails,

Dwindling into oblivion,
Never—

Never again—
Will I see my face

Reflected in the village pond
Where the noontime sun

Dazzles like a thousand dragonflies.
###
Goneril:
\qquad \qquad My sister!
That green-eyed, that half-starved cat—
Always sniffing about for scraps and obscenely
Devouring the mere scent of the new hatch’d Earl—
Purr’d her seductions even as servants

Cringed under her snapping commands—Ha!
I stilled her silken voice with my honeyed poison.
Yet still I suffocate in my own heat: my skin
Radiant with fury, my heart infuriate,

A fume of blood clouding my eyes—but one
Thrust of the blind steel, and the cooling dark
Of death will be mine.  And he will not be long
Distant from my side.  Even now he bleeds apace

And the frost in his heart begins to chill
The extremities.  I must be off, my knife
Must take me, my stroke prove fierce as my
Desire.  I dared betray a husband, a sister—

Two!—a father, a country—all paid—
Even my own life—as tax to my love—
And he will find me—mistress—his—
In the embrace of death, beloved.
###
Regan:
He was mine—

He will return to me
In death. We
Are each other’s

Master and mistress.
Queen and asp
Twined on wrist

Latched in final
Kiss on breast
And breast.

Paired with me
In death:\qquad
\hspace*{3\vgap} Bury us

In one coffin.
###
Albany:
The battle is won. The day is lost. The King is dead.
Evening light fades, and the keening wind
Whips the first sting of winter in our faces.
Tomorrow, at earliest light, the gallowglasses will disperse
Leaving behind fields of crushed grain

Crossed by footpaths.  Where thousands walked
Yesterday, none will walk tomorrow.  So too with us.
In heartless winter, a sparrow, sleet-pelted,
Veers through the high lit window
And finds brief refuge in the festival hall.

Winter rages dim.  So too we
For a space knew light and warmth, the company
Of our fellows.  Above our heads
Sparks from the hearth, rising in the chimney’s throat,
Winked out like meteors in smoky skies.

An omen, could we but have read it.

Now the meteors are fallen to ash
The granaries are empty

And the King is dead.
###
Fool:
Where the moat is overtaken by marsh still
Dark as the underside of Hell: a withered old heron
Patiently waiting for death. Yellow eyes hooded
With age, he scans the reflected heavens

For a sign. Smooth as a child’s eyelid
The sky opens, the curtain of dawn lifts:
A veil of light over wrinkling water
And unmoving bird. The earl, when I found him,

Lay in the shadow of the old castle—
Crumbling walls, windows full of wind—
Fading into shadow himself, his journey
Finished, patiently waiting for death.
###
Edmund:
Death consumes me.

Scales crust my eyes.
My bones crumble

And the dust dissolves in the rasping wind.
My brother has abandoned

My grave and denies
My name. From this darkness

The sunlight is blinding.
The breeze—once so sweet with rain—

Tastes of decay.
\hspace*{2\vgap} What animal lust

Once fleshed this desiccate spirit
Is now colder than the dust

Mingling with my own. \qquad The grave
Is now the echoing house

To my dwindling ghost, is all
The palace my dust will know, is all

The monument to call forth
The curse of my name amongst the living.

The Fool:
On the road past the blackened villages,
The ashes cold under a hard blue sky,
I left, since Death had taken all—the King
I would not call King, and his youngest—
I left, knowing Death was approaching

Winding toward me across the waste
Of muddy fields and empty nights
Intervening.  I left
And rode toward Death.  The war cut down
Earls and dukes, their officers, and soldiers

By the thousands, faceless as dirt, villeins
Dragged into the flames of their lords’ petty hells:
Wrath without reason, without justice, without cause.
The world is a furnace, the world is full of death.
So it is. So it is.  Look at it—but look.

Look up.  The tucked and smocked
Underbellies of the clouds—as ornate as any
Courtier’s sleeve—catch the saffron and cinnabar
Flame of sunset before charring to ash
With nightfall—
\hspace*{2\vgap} All vanity, all

Transience, to be sure, but
In the instant, so
Stunning everything else
Is forgotten, held
Back at the margin of vision—

Even Death for these few seconds
Still and hushed.
But cold night damp rises
Out of the marsh and a sickle moon
Looks unblinkingly down at me.
That’s not the pretty smocking

Of a courtier’s sleeve, nor
Mi’lady’s ribboned hair
Let down in darkening ripples
As her dress falls and the bed rocks.
That crimson

Is the pan of coals some cruel or
Careless god has thrown down,
And if they light our way
Or sear our feet and immolate
Our children, why

There’s no why, no way, to be had:
The path’s the same: it’s mine:
Join me.  Leave behind those true
Fools: gilded butterflies
Almost solemn

In their vanities:
They fan the perfumed
Chamber air
Unseeing
Unseeing

Though the clouds descending are red as blood.

Edgar:
The starlings, with a cacophony almost
Mechanical, rise out of the hedgerows
And fan across the stubble fields
Like a single wing, a single intelligence compelling
Its swoop and rise. . . .

\hspace*{3\vgap} All, all, swept away.

Only excepting a miscellany of lords,
The good Duke, and my newly-titled and
Richly-robed self, harmless as the kid
Killed to make my gloves.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Late in the day
I watch the sun sink and fade
Dragging its ragged banners down and through
Trees like black sabers. \qquad The world is thorned. . . .

Towards winter,
Armies, ten thousand strong, swarm
Like starlings, like locusts, like some
Glittering gust of wasps
Darkening as they converge

A shroud on the land.\qquad

Albany:
Domine labia mea aperies. 1

I can see the bodies laid out before me.
And I can see the cold, the sharp
Clouds, the narrowed
Eyes of the mourners.\qquad Shock

Eclipsing thought, our grief
Became as the sadness
Of animals, mute,
Uncomprehending.

Deus in audiutorium meum intende.2

If in the morning I waken
And have forgotten
By evening the marble cold
Is in my bones again.\qquad The fields

Laid waste in that final battle
Have greened and thickened
Over bones never interred,
Never honored.\qquad God you have seen

Fit to let the crows parade
Stiff-legged through the fields
Scavenging corpse and corn
Without distinction.

Converte nos deus salutaris noster. 3

We swallow our despair
To praise you.


1. Lord open thou my mouth. The absent second half is
   Et os meum annunciabat  laudentuam:
   And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
2. God make speed to save me.
3. Direct us, O God of our salvation.

These Latin quotes are from the prayers for the canonical hour of Matins.

Edgar:
Death approaches.

Darkness swallows the forests and rivers.

Darkness settles on the villages and towns.

Darkness spills down the furrows of the plowed fields.

Darkness pools in the byres and sties.

Darkness scales the eyes of the dead.

Darkness inflects the speech of the living.

The years have gathered into darkness
And darkness rises in my heart.
But my limbs are light. I have unfastened

My velvet robes, emptied my purse,
Unburdened and stripped myself
Down to the flesh, if not the soul.

I will cast off the past with the future.
Yet as death and oblivion begin to ferry me
Down their lightless empty rivers

I shake loose, before the final
Dissolution, I shake loose the dusty
Traces of death, like ashes

Crumbling on pink coals, and remark
My skin, delicate with age, my breathing,
Delicate with an urgency I can no

Longer sustain. Sunlight this
Early in spring is still weak,
But warm, and promising heat come

Summer.
\hspace*{3\vgap} The breeze turns cool.  Afternoons still
The shadows grow long, like the teeth of wolves.
His wolfish daughters—murderers, murdered—both

Dead—borne off to lie with their common betrothed,
Dead also: a frame terrible enough for his entrance
Bearing Cordelia, the sacrifice more fierce in the fulfillment

Than in the poetry describing it.
\hspace*{3\vgap} As that flame
Consumed them both, what whisper then
On Cordelia’s lips?  What did he hear

When love’s silence gathered its full force
And asked nothing of him?
\hspace*{3\vgap} And he,
On the cusp of darkness himself, did he

Have nothing, give nothing
Gazing on her face in love’s new light
Winking seraphim flames amid cinders?
###
Lear:
No cause. No cause to burn on the wheel of fire
To writhe and toil in the unyielding Hell
Of rage or jealousy, waxing to fullness
And ebbing only to crowd and choke my heart

Again: they never cool their sulphurous flames
Never green, never foliate, never lead to nor become
The still and temperate garden, Eden,
Prison, if you will, outside of which I am

Content not to stray, outside of which the world
Burns and decays. Within, a silence opens
The heart comprehends; within, love demands
No tongue of love. But my daughter’s voice—

Ever soft—gentle and low— whispers
Like a breeze in the grass. Now I bend close
To listen. A murmur brushes my ear
Never rising to words. But her meaning

Is clear. No questions remain.
