\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Edmund} I will captain Death's\\*
Grim troops, I will command\\*
The horses, black as iron,\\*
And the brute riders;

I will demand thunder and plague\\*
To wrack and consume my enemies\\*
To confound and silence\\*
My friends.

\qquad In this world---in this\\*
World---there is always\\*
A cause: power.   The world\\*
To be taken.   My desire\\*
To take it.

Yours in the ranks of Death\\*
I say,   and mean all and everyone\\*
In service

To Death.
\end{verse}
