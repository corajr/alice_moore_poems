\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Death consumes me.

Scales crust my eyes.\\*
My bones crumble

And the dust dissolves in the rasping wind.\\*
My brother has abandoned

My grave and denies\\*
My name. From this darkness

The sunlight is blinding.\\*
The breeze---once so sweet with rain---

Tastes of decay.\\*
\hspace*{2\vgap} What animal lust

Once fleshed this desiccate spirit\\*
Is now colder than the dust

Mingling with my own. \qquad The grave\\*
Is now the echoing house

To my dwindling ghost, is all\\*
The palace my dust will know, is all

The monument to call forth\\*
The curse of my name amongst the living.
\end{verse}
