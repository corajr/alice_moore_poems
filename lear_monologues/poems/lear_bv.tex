\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
No cause. No cause to burn on the wheel of fire\\*
To writhe and toil in the unyielding Hell\\*
Of rage or jealousy, waxing to fullness\\*
And ebbing only to crowd and choke my heart

Again: they never cool their sulphurous flames\\*
Never green, never foliate, never lead to nor become\\*
The still and temperate garden, Eden,\\*
Prison, if you will, outside of which I am

Content not to stray, outside of which the world\\*
Burns and decays. Within, a silence opens\\*
The heart comprehends; within, love demands\\*
No tongue of love. But my daughter's voice---

Ever soft---gentle and low--- whispers\\*
Like a breeze in the grass. Now I bend close\\*
To listen. A murmur brushes my ear\\*
Never rising to words. But her meaning

Is clear. No questions remain.
\end{verse}
