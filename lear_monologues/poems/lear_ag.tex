\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Eighty winters---some\\*
Without their corresponding summer---\\*
Have crowned him white; when\\*
Did he first look up

And see death in its stuttering\\*
Vulture's flight, fixing his gaze\\*
With Death's own\\*
Inflexible eye?\hspace*{3\vgap} He thinks

To yield the crown now\\*
To his daughters \& thus rob\\*
Death of the theft?   Still\\*
Even as he sidesteps Death

A king in check\\*
He makes his demands, demands\\*
Attention, demands answers.\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} But

His youngest stands apart, pale,\\*
A birch in earliest spring,\\*
Budded, not leafed. She'll not speak---\\*
I know her.

\hspace*{3\vgap} The elder two?\\*
Their oaths\\*
Blister their tongues---\\*
Or should.

Tricked out in their finery\\*
Like the enameled bird\\*
Of Orient myth, they are\\*
As mechanical in their praise,

But like that chiming\\*
Nightingale, too soon\\*
The gears grind, the heart\\*
Seizes, the machine

Clicks and dings its final\\*
Sour note.\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} What\\*
Could she say, Cordelia, what\\*
Would she have said,

In another world,\\*
In a different room,\\*
Not asked this\\*
Question, a question

Which never should be asked.
\end{verse}
