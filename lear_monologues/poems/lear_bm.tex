\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Goneril} \qquad \qquad My sister!\\*
That green-eyed, that half-starved cat---\\*
Always sniffing about for scraps and obscenely\\*
Devouring the mere scent of the new hatch'd Earl---\\*
Purr'd her seductions even as servants

Cringed under her snapping commands---Ha!\\*
I stilled her silken voice with my honeyed poison.\\*
Yet still I suffocate in my own heat: my skin\\*
Radiant with fury, my heart infuriate,

A fume of blood clouding my eyes---but one\\*
Thrust of the blind steel, and the cooling dark\\*
Of death will be mine.  And he will not be long\\*
Distant from my side.  Even now he bleeds apace

And the frost in his heart begins to chill\\*
The extremities.  I must be off, my knife\\*
Must take me, my stroke prove fierce as my\\*
Desire.  I dared betray a husband, a sister---

Two!---a father, a country---all paid---\\*
Even my own life---as tax to my love---\\*
And he will find me---mistress---his---\\*
In the embrace of death, beloved.
