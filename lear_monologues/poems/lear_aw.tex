\PoemTitle[Lear: On the moor]{Lear:}
\label{ch:lear_aw}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Down my bones in an ice-water burn.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
On the moor\\*
In my own Hell\\*
Battered

By a storm of my own making\\*
I curse the booming thunder\\*
Too weak to smother

The relentless whispers\\*
Rising, serpent-like,\\*
From the cracked

Earth of my heart:\\*
Their sweet-slippery\\*
Oaths of devotion

Hiss in my ears, hiss\\*
In my thoughts, hiss\\*
Down my bones in an ice-water burn.
\end{verse}
