\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Cordelia} If, in truth, we become God's spies,\\*
Where will we watch from?   And what\\*
Will we come to know?\qquad The mystery\\*
Of things is not God's domain;

Entering the mystery of things,\\*
What must we leave behind?  Will we carry\\*
Our flawed and human hearts\\*
With us?\qquad Or is the heart after all

A gilded cage, disintegrating\\*
As the body decays?   Dust and fear\\*
Dissolving like night's end\\*
In a fringe of gold as day

Rises to consume darkness and its stars. . . ?

But once untethered, free from the weight of body\\*
And breath---unbound from the wheel\\*
Of day and night, and watching in silence,

Immured in silence:

No matter how many days and nights\\*
Chase each other's tails,

Dwindling into oblivion,\\*
Never---

Never again---\\*
Will I see my face

Reflected in the village pond\\*
Where the noontime sun

Dazzles like a thousand dragonflies.
\end{verse}
