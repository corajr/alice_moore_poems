\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Regan} He was mine---

He will return to me\\*
In death. We\\*
Are each other's

Master and mistress.\\*
Queen and asp\\*
Twined on wrist

Latched in final\\*
Kiss on breast\\*
And breast.

Paired with me\\*
In death:\qquad\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} Bury us

In one coffin.
\end{verse}
