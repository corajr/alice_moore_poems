\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The starlings, with a cacophony almost\\*
Mechanical, rise out of the hedgerows\\*
And fan across the stubble fields\\*
Like a single wing, a single intelligence compelling\\*
Its swoop and rise. . . .

\hspace*{3\vgap} All, all, swept away.

Only excepting a miscellany of lords,\\*
The good Duke, and my newly-titled and\\*
Richly-robed self, harmless as the kid\\*
Killed to make my gloves.

\hspace*{3\vgap} Late in the day\\*
I watch the sun sink and fade\\*
Dragging its ragged banners down and through\\*
Trees like black sabers. \qquad The world is thorned. . . .

Towards winter,\\*
Armies, ten thousand strong, swarm\\*
Like starlings, like locusts, like some\\*
Glittering gust of wasps\\*
Darkening as they converge

A shroud on the land.\qquad
\end{verse}
