\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Kent} The sky opened on pandemonium\\*
With every flash of lightning.

Between bolt and crack\\*
A hairsbreadth, a heartbeat

Of silence---reprieve from damnation---\\*
Then the rumble and crash of the gods

Falling to their deaths as the heavens\\*
Cracked into shrapnel.   Little matter

Those deaths: living or dead, the gods\\*
Have left us.\qquad A cold rain

Washes the stones and rubble.\\*
My sword has become a cross I drag

As I labor through the daimon-haunted world,\\*
The Hell we have forged for ourselves

No god attending.
\end{verse}
