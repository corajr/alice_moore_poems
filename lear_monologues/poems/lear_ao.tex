\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Regan} My husband?\\*
I found him---serviceable. Fiery.\\*
Not like that melancholic and milk-livered\\*
Dull fool my sister has leashed. But---

Just as I \textit{might} have wished---\\*
A kind of mutinous pity\\*
Turned everything upside down\\*
And set me free.

First the cringing Gloucester pitied\\*
My scarecrow father, lurching about the moor---\\*
So stuffed him in some hovel,\\*
Fed him bread and onions,

And under questioning looked\\*
So pink with guilt I almost laughed.\\*
Then that stupid boy: pale and quaking\\*
Even as he raged with pity!

Pity.  He was slender as a reed,\\*
Hardly bearded. I ran at him behind,\\*
But before that thrust took him,\\*
His one lucky stroke took my lord

And dragged him after into death.\\*
His fire extinguished, mine flared---\\*
And, \textit{my} most dear Gloucester,\\*
You will find me here,\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} Smiling

Amid the ashes,\\*
\hspace*{2\vgap} Awaiting your coming\\*
My husband.
\end{verse}
