\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The battle is won. The day is lost. The King is dead.\\*
Evening light fades, and the keening wind\\*
Whips the first sting of winter in our faces.\\*
Tomorrow, at earliest light, the gallowglasses will disperse\\*
Leaving behind fields of crushed grain

Crossed by footpaths.  Where thousands walked\\*
Yesterday, none will walk tomorrow.  So too with us.\\*
In heartless winter, a sparrow, sleet-pelted,\\*
Veers through the high lit window\\*
And finds brief refuge in the festival hall.

Winter rages dim.  So too we\\*
For a space knew light and warmth, the company\\*
Of our fellows.  Above our heads\\*
Sparks from the hearth, rising in the chimney's throat,\\*
Winked out like meteors in smoky skies.

An omen, could we but have read it.

Now the meteors are fallen to ash\\*
The granaries are empty

And the King is dead.
\end{verse}
