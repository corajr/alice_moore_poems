\label{ch:lear_ax}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Myself, middling indifferent and unblinking,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I have passed from light into darkness\\*
From comfort to cold terror\\*
Cast out of my own house\\*
Tearless, for my eyes are blood,

And I am blind.  Once upon a time\\*
I had two sons, both loved alike;\\*
Vassals who served; a king I served;\\*
Untenanted days I let accumulate

---I let pass---without thought.\\*
The indifference of the gods\\*
Seemed benign, like sunlight\\*
Flashing on blossom, face,

And forged steel the same.  Only\\*
This morning they gave me,\\*
Took from me, for the last time,\\*
The world taking shape

In gold light.  Everything\\*
Reappearing just where the gods,\\*
In their play, or their\\*
Indifference, had left it.  But

I was like a little bloated god\\*
Myself, middling indifferent and unblinking,\\*
Unseeing, hardly pausing\\*
To look at what would be gone

By nightfall.    Ah\\*
Even as I glanced, the peregrine world\\*
Fled: I could not hold days,\\*
King, vassals, or sons, and parted

From all I knew, knowing all only\\*
In darkness, blindness, the gods'

Last, most terrible gift.
