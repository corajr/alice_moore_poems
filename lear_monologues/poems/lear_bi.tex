\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Edgar} \hspace*{6\vgap} But logic

Fails. The \textit{fabula} of the heart dance\\*
On the head of a pin: the learned philosophers\\*
Must either dance with them or shiver through\\*
The night, asking \textit{How many}, and \textit{Why}

\textit{Dance}?
\end{verse}
