\Character{Regan} As for Cordelia---\\*
Vestal, immured\\*
In silence as pure as her words

Would be\\*
If she did not worry language\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} Like a terrier---

She scrapes and gnaws\\*
Meaning down to the\\*
Bones

\hspace*{3\vgap} Till each word is separate\\*
Polished\\*
Glinting in its own light.

But never\\*
Pure enough.  In vain\\*
The struggle: our father hears only the

Rattle of those bones, the\\*
Nothing that so terrifies him\\*
And makes of him a drum for the thunder to pound.

Pitiful\\*
Little King, littler man,\\*
Whittled, forked, stripped

Crashing about the moor\\*
And burning with lightning's dark\\*
Heat. \qquad He sees all

Only\\*
In its stark\\*
Blue-white

Light---\\*
And learns too late\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} How dark my darkness is.
\end{verse}
