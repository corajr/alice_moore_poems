\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Lear} Survey my kingdom, map it, parish and pasture,\\*
Shrine and shire, sun-swept lea and field\\*
Bordering forest thick-set with trees as arrows

Jammed in their quivers.  Follow the rivers\\*
To their dark beginnings, and number the fish;\\*
Measure the farms and their meadows, the height

Of the mountains, the weight of their shadows.\\*
Measure, number, weigh: write it\\*
Down---I will divide it with a stroke of my hand.

Give me the map there.
\end{verse}
