\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{The Fool} Untroubled by the alchemical giddiness of words,\\*
I am Cordelia's double, her cocky twin, hop-\\*
Scotching, always, just on the far side

Of the King's rages, king-size, and useless.   Mine\\*
Is the tongue not twisted by a filial\\*
Love as political at the heart as any

Bribe.\qquad I raddle the pale\\*
Figures of speech, I ambush\\*
Expectation, shame polite

Discourse with lies, insults\\*
So outrageous their truth\\*
Stumps rage, staggers reason, halts

Even the imperious, despairing\\*
King in his tracks.\qquad You cannot stand\\*
In this world, if you wish to speak

The truth of it.  The one way\\*
To articulate---not divide, not reduce, not\\*
Obscure it---

\vinphantom{Obscure it---} Is to make clowns of the words,\\*
Fire of the speech\\*
And burn the house down.
\end{verse}
