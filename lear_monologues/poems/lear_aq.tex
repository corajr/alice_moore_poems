\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Protect us?\\*
From hag \& hungry

Goblin? From demons\\*
Smulkin and Fratteretto?

Or from\\*
Skulking brother

Disguised by his\\*
Elders' too temperate

Imagination:\\*
Were Mad Tom

Truly mad\\*
He would not make

Oaths to defend ye.\\*
The mad

Can't defend themselves\\*
Let alone

Those who look\\*
To them

For amusement.
