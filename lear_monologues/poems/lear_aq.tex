\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Fool} \textit{Protect us?}\\*
From \textit{hag \& hungry}

\textit{Goblin}? From demons\\*
\textit{Smulkin} and \textit{Fratteretto}?

Or from\\*
Skulking brother

Disguised by his\\*
Elders' too temperate

Imagination:\\*
Were Mad Tom

Truly mad\\*
He would not make

Oaths to \textit{defend ye}.\\*
The mad

Can't defend themselves\\*
Let alone

Those who look\\*
To them

For amusement.
\end{verse}
