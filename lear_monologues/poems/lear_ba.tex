\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Edgar} Not a king, not a father, barely\\*
The stick figure of a man, banished\\*
To the treeless heath and there

Mazed, stripped, seared by lightning\\*
By hunger hollowed so that his every howl\\*
Shivers my bones, he reviles his daughters:

Wolf, serpent, monster.  Woman. Excrement\\*
In his hair, smeared on pink and white flesh,\\*
All his thought knotted up with

Wrath and revulsion, he has no speech not\\*
Burning with sulphurous oaths.\\*
Worse even than anything his hellish

Daughters could have contrived, it's a hell\\*
Of his own making and with it he curses\\*
Us all.
\end{verse}
