\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Regan} When one cannot command, one flatters.\\*
Nothing swells speech like praise: the more\\*
Outlandish, the more stunned and unquestioning\\*
The heart of my frail and foolish father.

\hspace*{5\vgap} Praise diverts\\*
The rational mind: he chases the lovely thought\\*
Like a child tripping after a butterfly---\\*
Not seeing the dark forest it wings towards.

\hspace*{5\vgap} Too late\\*
He stutters in his fury, stamping, stymied\\*
By this smiling daughter turned\\*
Iron-willed mistress of her realm.
\end{verse}
