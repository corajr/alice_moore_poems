\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Edmund} With the vengefulness of a minor god\\*
He blinded the gabbling old man\\*
And left him stumbling\\*
In gory darkness.\\*
\qquad \qquad \qquad But the Duke\\*
Did not live to see the old man

Sightless.\hspace*{3\vgap} Gored\\*
In that very moment, he\\*
Was taken by a servant's just\\*
Quick enough strike.\\*
\qquad \qquad \qquad Unless

Regan herself---would she have\\*
Held this back?---took servant\\*
And ranting husband in single\\*
Efficient thrust?\\*
\qquad \qquad \qquad I must doubt\\*
And turn my thoughts

Elsewhere.
\end{verse}
