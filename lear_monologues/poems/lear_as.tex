\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
How could I not know her? Her own father\\*
Did not know her.  A woman's shape, a daughter's\\*
Face, a wife's deference---though never

Did she yield, not really: too ready\\*
Her ``Yes, my lord.''  Performed, not felt.\\*
Smiling, enraged, she grew quiet---

The slightest twitch, only, as a cat's tail\\*
Before fatal lunge, betraying the fiend\\*
Quivering, sheathed, in her skin.
\end{verse}
