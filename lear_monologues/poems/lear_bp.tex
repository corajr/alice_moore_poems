\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Fool} Where the moat is overtaken by marsh still\\*
Dark as the underside of Hell: a withered old heron\\*
Patiently waiting for death. Yellow eyes hooded\\*
With age, he scans the reflected heavens

For a sign. Smooth as a child's eyelid\\*
The sky opens, the curtain of dawn lifts:\\*
A veil of light over wrinkling water\\*
And unmoving bird. The earl, when I found him,

Lay in the shadow of the old castle---\\*
Crumbling walls, windows full of wind---\\*
Fading into shadow himself, his journey\\*
Finished, patiently waiting for death.
\end{verse}
