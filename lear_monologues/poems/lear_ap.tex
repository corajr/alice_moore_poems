\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Were I truly mad, how far away\\*
Then the demons of my scorpion griefs---\\*
Then might the monsters of other's

Fears dog me: whelked \&\\*
Whorled, clawed \& cloven, leering\\*
Fraternity over church door or bestial

Faces in the smoke of forge or brazier:\\*
All the stuff \& nonsense spun\\*
To fright the wicked child.   Naught

Frights that child---or man.   That\\*
Man smiles, leers, calls\\*
Me brother.\qquad Were I truly mad

Then could I leave:\\*
The bad dreams of Bedlam beggars unfold\\*
Beneath infinite skies; the gods

Sprinkle them with stars.   But Edmund---\\*
If he could---would carapace the face\\*
Of infinity, take hammer \&

Tongs \& burning brand\\*
To anything not cog or gear\\*
In the machine of his will:

No world otherwise\\*
For him.\hspace*{3\vgap} Now

From the long shadows\\*
Cast by dawn I watch

The terrible dark\\*
Engine approach:

Ten thousand men\\*
In iron boots

Ten thousand men\\*
With iron teeth

Churning through fields\\*
Villages\hspace*{3\vgap} the blue

Strangeness of dreams\\*
Nightmares---

The geared toys\\*
Of the man who swears

He is forever free\\*
Of that toy

The human heart.
