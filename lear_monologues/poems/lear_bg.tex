\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Cordelia} I watch him burning, flowers in his hair\\*
Pinks, long wilted daisies, and swamp iris,\\*
Their green sabers failing to guard\\*
The purple hearts, inflated chambers

Mashed where the crown should rest, but he\\*
Does not rest, he burns on Ixion's wheel\\*
Spinning through Hell's hell, the dark\\*
And empty air of his now dark and

Un-peopled world. Everyone he has known\\*
Transformed or gone. Memories ghosts.\\*
Pitching about the moors, now,\\*
His commands are swallowed by the windy silence.
\end{verse}
