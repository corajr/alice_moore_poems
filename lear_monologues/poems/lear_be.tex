\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Edgar} In the autumn months, he comes\\*
Backward through the night:\\*
From dawn to midnight, midnight\\*
To the watered dark of early\\*
Evening.   Now the forked twig figure---

\hspace*{3\vgap} Orion---\\*
Naked in the winter's sheer cold---\\*
Is visible in the east, above\\*
The sutured fields, the heath and peat bogs,\\*
Where somewhere my father wanders,

Blind, sure

He is the god's plaything, the toy\\*
Of their idle wrath.\qquad `T is no such thing.\\*
The gods have turned away.\\*
They have eternity\\*
To amuse themselves or feel remorse

Which is to them only\\*
Another seductive amusement.\\*
I must be my father's new god\\*
Shaping the world beyond\\*
The black shapes of his blindness

Into the possibility\\*
His life's a miracle\\*
And these arms\\*
Are his son's\\*
Arms cradling him.
\end{verse}
