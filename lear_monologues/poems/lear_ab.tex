\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The rare holy day or feast---or perhaps some\\*
Too hot summer morn the dragonflies,\\*
Darting into the haze, carried off all thought---\\*
I might bring him his ale; seeing him distract'd,

Crown him with daisies, flowers\\*
Simple as a child's scribble, white and yellow stars\\*
Strung in a loose circlet that soon fell\\*
From brow to breast as the links opened

And his thoughts returned. He was a king,\\*
Subject to his subjects, subject\\*
To his rages. But sometimes\\*
Of a morning, sometimes of an afternoon

The overcast in his eyes withdrew\\*
The storm cleared, I saw that glint\\*
Of blue--- and then I approached\\*
Wreathing him with daisies, or with my free

Hand hooking the dangling hawthorn blossoms\\*
To catch us in a sheltering bower, a shelter\\*
Lost in whiplash release when I let go,\\*
And cast my arms about his neck, my arms

Become the garland and my whispers the sweet\\*
Echoes of his own thoughts.   So the linnet\\*
Calls and further down the heath\\*
Another linnet, returning, returns

His call with her own--- and so they sing\\*
Carelessly half-echoing, half\\*
Anticipating song with song, a world\\*
It seems, to him, without beginning

And so---it must be---without end.
\end{verse}
