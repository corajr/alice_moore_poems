\settowidth{\versewidth}{Has teeth, and that the world is not}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
No, not wolves.   Wolves,\\*
After all, have a kind of nobility:\\*
A clan that knows the winter

Has teeth, and that the world is not\\*
Much kinder, their ferocity\\*
Is, for the most part, not

For each alone, but is\\*
Service to the natural leader,\\*
Their cyning if you like. For

The most part.  But these, these,\\*
Parading on their hind legs,\\*
Are vermin despite their velvet

And crowns.\qquad They slip\\*
From shadows into moonlight\\*
And their hearts are as pale,

And bloodless.
\end{verse}
