\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\qquad \qquad Reverend\\*
Father, old man,\\*
You do not go but you should\\*
To the lightless place where the river twists\\*
Over mossy stones: silvery voices rise off\\*
Unseen currents: the voices of sirens, whispering---

Rasping the ear---then drifting across heath\\*
So vast a man there might himself\\*
Lose---till wolves and harpies\\*
Found him.\qquad You should go there\\*
Once, with a deaf army to hold you

Back---you might recognize\\*
Now the trick of tempting\\*
Fools to hear, to believe---\\*
Even when they half-way despise---\\*
What they desire.
\end{verse}
