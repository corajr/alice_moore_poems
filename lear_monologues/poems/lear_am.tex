\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{3\vgap} But then

It may be you are\\*
That rare man, the one, one

Only, perhaps, who takes their breath\\*
Away.\qquad The rest?

Dull as husbands.\\*
Fools whose spindles

Of bone and flags\\*
Of withered flesh

Even now decay and fade,\\*
Ghastly banners

Amid empty boulders\\*
Where once sirens

Silvery and shimmering in brief\\*
Morning light

Sang.\\*
And lied.
\end{verse}
