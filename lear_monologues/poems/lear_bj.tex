\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{3\vgap} Wash his limbs,\\*
Wash his hands and feet. His face\\*
He has washed with his own tears\\*
Too many times. From his loosening grip

Take the nettles and cowslips, furrow-weed and twig\\*
Forked and of a sudden wondrous---or horrible---\\*
As mandrake root torn screaming\\*
From its native element.  Let his Hell dissolve:

Ghosts, smoke, wisps unraveling\\*
In daylight. Let him waken to music;\\*
Let him waken and not die.\\*
Let him find his daughter, his true

Daughter, for so I am,\\*
I am.
\end{verse}
