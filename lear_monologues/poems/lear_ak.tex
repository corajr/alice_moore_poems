\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Cornwall} You---boy---put aside your beer and beef and gossip.\\*
Your mistress---if that is what you call her---\\*
Will wait.  Prepare my silk robe, my purple gown,\\*
The one trimmed with fur. And you---what's your name?

To horse and inform---don't interrupt---\\*
Inform the Earl that we---I and my Regan---\\*
Travel hence with urgency that compels\\*
Defiance of night's uncertain terrors

And requires of him his immediate---and kind---\\*
Hospitality.   We'll follow\\*
Almost at your heels. Now go, go, go, go!\\*
I am the Duke!  I will be obeyed!
\end{verse}
