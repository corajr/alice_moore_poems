\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Domine labia mea aperies. 1

I can see the bodies laid out before me.\\*
And I can see the cold, the sharp\\*
Clouds, the narrowed\\*
Eyes of the mourners.     Shock

Eclipsing thought, our grief\\*
Became as the sadness\\*
Of animals, mute,\\*
Uncomprehending.

Deus in audiutorium meum intende.2

If in the morning I waken\\*
And have forgotten\\*
By evening the marble cold\\*
Is in my bones again.     The fields

Laid waste in that final battle\\*
Have greened and thickened\\*
Over bones never interred,\\*
Never honored.     God you have seen

Fit to let the crows parade\\*
Stiff-legged through the fields\\*
Scavenging corpse and corn\\*
Without distinction.

Converte nos deus salutaris noster. 3

We swallow our despair\\*
To praise you.

\\*
1. Lord open thou my mouth. The absent second half is\\*
   Et os meum annunciabat  laudentuam:\\*
   And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.\\*
2. God make speed to save me.\\*
3. Direct us, O God of our salvation.
