\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Domine labia mea aperies.\footnote{Lord open thou my mouth. The absent second half is \textit{Et os meum annunciabat laudentuam:} And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.}

I can see the bodies laid out before me.\\*
And I can see the cold, the sharp\\*
Clouds, the narrowed\\*
Eyes of the mourners.\qquad Shock

Eclipsing thought, our grief\\*
Became as the sadness\\*
Of animals, mute,\\*
Uncomprehending.

Deus in audiutorium meum intende.\footnote{God make speed to save me.}

If in the morning I waken\\*
And have forgotten\\*
By evening the marble cold\\*
Is in my bones again.\qquad The fields

Laid waste in that final battle\\*
Have greened and thickened\\*
Over bones never interred,\\*
Never honored.\qquad God you have seen

Fit to let the crows parade\\*
Stiff-legged through the fields\\*
Scavenging corpse and corn\\*
Without distinction.

Converte nos deus salutaris noster.\footnote{Direct us, O God of our salvation.\\ These Latin quotes are from the prayers for the canonical hour of Matins.}

We swallow our despair\\*
To praise you.


\end{verse}
