\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Character{Lear} \hspace*{3\vgap} Too late\\*
I knew their flattery\\*
Flattery, every sentence over-blossomed,

Roses blown and shameless,\\*
Roses too scarlet, but roses promised\\*
To be mine.\qquad Too late

I knew myself naked

Unadorned    unaccommodated\\*
As any wretch---too late almost\\*
Knew what any and every wretch, on

Moor, in ditch, under storm or night\\*
Feels and knows.   Too foolish\\*
Even for a fool.   Once gold

Now debased; once imperial---\\*
Now pinioned.   Once I charged\\*
Nature herself to render account---

Now I am chastened\\*
Burned down to ash and ember\\*
And hissing flame.
\end{verse}
