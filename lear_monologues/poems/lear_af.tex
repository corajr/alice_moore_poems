\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
O swallow\\*
Perplexing the eye in flight beyond scansion yet\\*
More graceful in plummet and swoop, acrobatic\\*
In wink and flash over the rusting fields\\*
Than merlin or peregrine in their single-\\*
Minded bolt from blazing sky---

O swallow\\*
Lend me your grace\\*
And let my words scour his heart\\*
Till it becomes a hermit's cell and his own words\\*
Whisper back from the walls. Then

O swallow\\*
Then lend me your grace and your wings\\*
So that once, if once only, I might speak and say nothing\\*
Not shaped by perfect logic made irresistible\\*
By perfect grace. Before the sky, gleaming\\*
Like a thousand scythes, lets loose its birds of prey.
\end{verse}
