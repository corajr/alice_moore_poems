\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Wishes are for children---\\*
Or women, like the Duke's smirking\\*
Un-mourning wife, purring like a cat in sunlight\\*
As her sister sweats and glares.     Both wish\\*
To make a meal of me,     and either,\\*
But not both,  may.\\*
Let them sort it out to their pleasure

Or distress.     The while I have other\\*
Business requiring a cool head.\\*
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad That, I say, the Duke\\*
Lacked.  He rushed. For think:

Why not let one eye mock the other?\\*
For an hour? Or a day?\\*
Let the face consider itself, destroyed.\\*
Let the mind contemplate the absolute\\*
Darkness to come.     Why rush the victims\\*
To the dung heap?     Calculate and let the engine\\*
Grind.\\*
\qquad Like a god who watches but who

Does not help and whose smile therefore\\*
Haunts---why not seem to watch\\*
As benignly, smile and coolly\\*
Go about one's business?  ---with neither

More nor less love for the task\\*
Than necessary---and let enemies\\*
---And friends too---make of one what they\\*
Wish.   I will make of mine---and of\\*
The world---\\*
What I\\*
Will.
