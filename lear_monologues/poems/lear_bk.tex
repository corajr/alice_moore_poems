\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
There is but one siren, and she sings to me.\\*
Her voice is not silvery and sweet, but low, dark,\\*
Thick with longing; parched with the heat of unsatisfied

Desire. I know her. She is like me. We gull and seduce\\*
Everyone else, like snakes that shed their tight, papery\\*
Skins, leave behind the ghosts of scales and faces

---A horrifying, beautiful distraction---\\*
While we emerge, glistening, vivid, undulant, our\\*
Forked tongues flickering like our lusts made

Incarnate---and still our prey are fascinated\\*
By the beauty that should horrify them,\\*
The beauty they should flee from.

There is but one siren, and her skin is soft as down.\\*
Remorseless, but why should she be other-

Wise?
\end{verse}
