\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\textit{How like us}\ldots we think,\\*
Godlike, daydreaming\\*
Of the ocean\\*
Of swimming out over our heads\\*
Cutting quick arcs in the sunlight---

Flashcubes pop: dolphins\\*
Leap through silvery hoops,\\*
Bark, tweet, mew: hurtle through our vision,\\*
Slippery mimics. The rest of the Aquarium\\*
Is an extension of this dream:

Bald face like a hundred-year-old child's\\*
The sea-turtle attempts to swim\\*
To us. Knocks against inch-thick\\*
Glass.     In other\\*
Smaller tanks, smaller

Fish, sequined, exotic\\*
As hot-house orchids, ballooning\\*
Bladders of light \& color---\\*
Prey? Of shark or dirigible\\*
Sea-turtle?
\end{verse}
