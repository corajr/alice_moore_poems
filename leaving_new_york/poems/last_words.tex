\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The air is so cold that our eyes water.\\
Over the Holyoke Range, the eastern sky\\
Is pale peach washed over pale gold.\\
But the shadows of the mountains are long

And most of Northampton still reclines\\
Beneath their blue veils.  The streets\\
Glint with frost.  At the station we offer\\
No tokens, no explanations.   Nothing

Suffices.  I whisper \textit{Ciao}: we kiss: I leave.\\
(In Venice, two years later, you whisper:\\
\textit{I watched you walk back up the hill.\\
It is not good to suffer too much.})

Three days afterward, you boarded a train\\
In Luxembourg \& arrived in Venice\\
---\textit{Venezia}---the next day as midnight\\
\qquad Closed on Northampton.
\end{verse}
