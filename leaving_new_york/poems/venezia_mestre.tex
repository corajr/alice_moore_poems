\PoemTitle{Venezia Mestre: At Your Friend Roberto's, Dinner}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Pasquale flirts with you in French; you\\
Return her glance as we eat.\\
Aida, the woman from Lebanon,\\
Speaks French also; everyone else speaks\\
French or Italian, fragmentary\\
English.  So during dinner,\\
I am mostly silent---your friends\\
---And you---lapse into native tongues\\
And I reminisce: England, the States,\\
How obscure they seems, how archaic\\
The language, English, useless\\
In the present.

\hspace*{3\vgap} In Paris\\
I did not speak at all.\\
The silent offer of money\\
Usually sufficed.\\
For three days, I was silent:\\
I silently paced the Louvre,\\
Haunted the Seine at dusk,\\
Craned my neck at Notre Dame\\
Got lost (it wasn't on the map)\\
In the red light district\\
Tracing my way\\
To the Pompidou Center.

The view from Monmarte required\\
More silence.   A silent\\
Consultation with my map returned me\\
To the Hotel D'Albion, where I inscribed\\
Postcards to friends in the States.\\
I hummed to keep myself company\\
And felt, as I drank a bottle of Bordeaux,\\
How empty, how without remorse\\
The wine-dark sea\\
Where travelers are forever\\
Lost, wandering\\
Toward a home withheld

Beneath the horizon.\\
You continue flirting with Pasquale\\
As the vaporetto scuds across sequined canals.\\
Later, fighting with you, I feel\\
That ocean, trackless \& vast,\\
Opening between us.\\
And, feeling it too, unable\\
To find a tongue for your sorrow,\\
You slap me\\
Once, hard, then\\
Stop,\\
\hspace*{2\vgap} Shocked---
\end{verse}
