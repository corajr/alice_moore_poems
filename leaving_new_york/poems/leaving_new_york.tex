\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
That night---\\*
The rain-slicked streets

A jazzy neon pattern---\\*
Striped \& stippled

Like animals we\\*
Rived traffic \& rain, tearing

Into the dark\\*
Shelter of the subway.

\hspace*{4\vgap} Dragging\\*
Luggage we clunked

Down the iron\\*
Stairs at Union

Square, I following\\*
You into the gritty

Light, the tiled under\\*
World---

Remember\\*
The graffiti?\qquad Spray-painted

Large \& fast,\\*
Illegible,

Entangling the subway\\*
Cars?   A token

And the three-headed turnstile\\*
Yields to the weight

Of my hips. Ahead:\\*
The black river---

The third rail---\\*
Glinting like an eel.
\end{verse}
