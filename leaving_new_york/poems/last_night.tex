\PoemTitle{Last Night: Northampton or Milano}
\label{ch:last_night}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{A tapering oblong of light falls across the floor:}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The last night was full\\
Of the ordinary darkness\\
Of every other night.\\
We fell asleep after making love\\
Though we lay half-

Awake, unspeaking\\
For longer than we knew.\\
Deep in the black morning\\
I awoke: you were leaning\\
Across me reaching

For the glass on the sill.\\
Empty. You rose, hushing me,\\
Half in Italian, half English.\\
A tapering oblong of light falls across the floor:\\
At its apex: you stand, naked, forked,

Animal in the illumined door.\\
You watch me\\
As you fill the glass,\\
Flick off the light,\\
Approach, offering me

Water. \hspace*{2\vgap} At 7 a.m.,\\
The alarm shivered sleep;\\
The glass stood on the bright sill,\\
Tears beading \& falling\\
Down its clear sides.
\end{verse}
