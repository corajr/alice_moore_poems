\PoemTitle{Listening to Neil Young in Upstate New York}
\label{ch:listening_to_neil_young}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Seamless descent 'til the lawn washes blue in the window}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Moonlight shivers mower, trash, abandoned\\*
Mirror; old bottles, tools lost in plain view: a still\\*
Life that absorbs an hour's thought when I wander,\\*
Thoughtless, to the garage at midnight.   Sleepless

I conclude in a kitchen chair, tracing Orion's\\*
Seamless descent `til the lawn washes blue in the window\\*
And whatever has been mysterious\\*
Sinks back into my heart, closes stone tablets

Across its graven face.\\*
\hspace*{3\vgap} Years, decades, have passed.\\*
Yet the same girl still traces the stark chiaroscuro\\*
Of everything the moon touches, the landscape,

A face, thrown into extremes of light\\*
And dark.\qquad Mystery\\*
Is a torment.\qquad But Orion tantalizes\\*
Me still, and I watch for him.
\end{verse}
