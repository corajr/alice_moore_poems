\settowidth{\versewidth}{Coils at the back of my brain}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Crackling

Knife\\
The water

In their narrow\\
Tanks, whip-

Lash hair-\\
Pin turns.     In the knot

Of dense nerves packed\\
Behind rigid eyes, a welter:

Sparks\\
Stuttering

Across synapses\\
Like gunfire.

Electrophorus electricus:\\
The eel

Coils at the back of my brain\\
Legless

Armless\\
Surrounded

By an electrical field:\\
How do they mate?  you ask---

(What of sexual\\
Desire

Slash\\
Instinct?)
\end{verse}
