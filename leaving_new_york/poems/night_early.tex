MIDNIGHT\\*
~\\*
You do not understand much English\\*
So the simplest words\\*
Must suffice.     Or none.\\*
A gesture, a green-gold glance---\\*
The oldest language.

ONE A.M.\\*
~\\*
The golden\\*
Moody wail\\*
Of the saxophone\\*
Again \& again returns, less\\*
Piercing, more piercing\\*
Than the silence between wails.

TWO A.M.\\*
~\\*
It's too far to reach.\\*
The light of a fallen meteor\\*
Suffuses our faces:\\*
The phosphorescent radio dial\\*
Glimmers greenly across the room.\\*
At 2 a.m. the station hisses\\*
Into static.\\*
Dark dark dark blue\\*
The night outside us\\*
Comprehends stars.

THREE A.M.\\*
~\\*
Naked:\\*
This is the essence of lovers.\\*
Nothing is beyond our embrace.\\*
We take shelter\\*
Where the other is\\*
Most vulnerable\\*
To a blow\\*
Or a kiss, a kiss\\*
Like a blow.

FIVE A.M.\\*
~\\*
Dawn is still\\*
An hour away\\*
But an electric blue sea\\*
Fills the windows,\\*
Washes over our faces, our eyelids\\*
Fluttering against sleep\\*
The tide\\*
Of oblivion.

DAWN\\*
~\\*
With dawn comes\\*
The return to\\*
Speech and light

Your sibilant tongue\\*
The whispering breeze that\\*
Relaxes the curled

Fists of my\\*
Dreams.
