\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\textit{Il Christo Morto}---Vecellio

He floats---or appears to---\\*
In an autumnal pond,\\*
Submerged in coppery water

Against a background of black rotted\\*
Oak leaves.   His chest is broad,\\*
But his yellowed ivory fingers

Are delicate.  Shadowy eyes closed,\\*
His face is slightly blurred, a watery\\*
Sepia print, highlighted with ochre.

The wound in his side is red\\*
But neither bleeds nor heals.\\*
In sleep, or death, he does not seem

At peace. There is a look of concentration\\*
As if he searches out the roots of pain,\\*
The tranquility that lies below

---Or beyond---the prodding thorns\\*
The torment that whispers he is flesh\\*
And flesh only.
\end{verse}
