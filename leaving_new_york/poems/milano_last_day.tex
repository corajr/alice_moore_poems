\settowidth{\versewidth}{For twelve months in the military.   Mandatory.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Once you were a boy\\*
And could go anywhere.

Now you are a man, \& your head\\*
Is shaved, preparation

For twelve months in the military.   Mandatory.\\*
In the morning, you will disappear---

The subway will swallow you.   And I'll leave---\\*
Five, six thousand miles distant---

This night, the last.\\*
We will have children

With other people, and wake to them\\*
And not regret it.     But in dreams---
\end{verse}
