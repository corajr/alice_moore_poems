\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{2\vgap} Appears blue-green \& motionless.

The train hurtles through backyards,\\
Past small houses backed with gardens:

Plowed earth, rows of pale cabbages, rows\\
Of tiny green stars stitched into the damp earth,

Borders of red flowers pulsing softly\\
As the fog lifts from the blue lawns.

Windows frame amber-lit scenes: a woman\\
Rinsing a white plate, holding it to the light;

A man gesticulating; two children\\
Sipping from two blue-patterned cups. In the street,

A man watches the train rattle past, opens\\
His car door, disappears

Into the dark interior.
\end{verse}
