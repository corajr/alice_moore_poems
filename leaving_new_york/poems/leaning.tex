\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Against the pale green tiles\\
A woman draped\\
In turquoise \& fuchsia\\
A toddler wrestles in her arms\\
Tugs her gold earrings \& grips her dark

Hair near the roots, drawing\\
Their flushed \& opposing faces\\
Together.     I am lost---\\
You tug my sleeve: the maps\\
Plastered everywhere, stripped

Of irregularities easily\\
Read by a child prove\\
The city a bare forked animal.\\
Throwing blue sparks\\
The train hurtles

Over your words, the hissed\\
Syllables don't reach\\
Me     you're yelling now\\
Now the train---\\
The crowd bellies

Forward---the brakes squeal\\
---Rush hour---screeches to a\\
---Hurry\\
---Halt!\\
---This is our train!
\end{verse}
