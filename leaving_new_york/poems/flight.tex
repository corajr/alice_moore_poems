\settowidth{\versewidth}{The suck of gravity will draw us earthward, again,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Only a thin envelope of metal shields\\
Several hundred passengers from the black\\
Plasma of trans-Atlantic night enveloping\\
The jet.\quad Miles below us, invisible, scrolls

Of black water churn between continents.\\
The suck of gravity will draw us earthward, again,\\
Down toward the clustered lights congealing\\
Out of the night: in this long moment

Suspended above the airport, my past globes\\
In the darkness behind me: all my friends die\\
And are buried in the kaleidoscopic\\
Geography, that careless, prismatic

Map, memory. \hspace*{1\vgap} It is not yet dawn.\\
The future is bright \& meaningless.\\
I'll take a train into the heart\\
\hspace*{1\vgap} Of the mystery, London.
\end{verse}
