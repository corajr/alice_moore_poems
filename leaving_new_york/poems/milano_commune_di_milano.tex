BOCCIONI A MILANO

Boccioni 1882-1916  Italian Futurist

An exhibition of his work alongside the paintings of artists who influenced him: Severini, Picasso, Carra.

\ldots \textit{It is easy to see\\*
The influence of Seurat}\ldots

\textit{Dabs of unblended pigment}\\*
\ldots \textit{Construct form}\ldots

\ldots \textit{Like the Fauves, harsh\\*
Bright `beastly' colors}

\textit{Rendered in\\*
`Divisionist notation':}

\textit{Swarming\\*
Brushstrokes magnetized}

\textit{In shockwave pulses\\*
`Express the vortex\ldots'}

\textit{`A life of steel \& fever' urged\\*
The self-declared madmen}

\textit{`Pride \& headlong speed. . .'\\*
`The materiality of bodies}

\textit{`Destroyed by motion \& light.'}

\hspace*{3\vgap} As we hover\\*
At the margins of the attentive\\*
Tour, their guide, the man

With sharp temples \& narrow hands\\*
Narrates in rapid Italian: \qquad you\\*
Alternately follow \& translate, splinter

His lecture but construe the sense:\\*
The helixes of meaning that pattern\\*
His speech now patternless

How we see: \textit{dabs of color, `beastly,'\\*
Swarming,} \qquad construct \qquad yet shiver\\*
And destroy the material body.
