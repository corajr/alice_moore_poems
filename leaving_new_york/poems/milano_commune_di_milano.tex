BOCCIONI A MILANO

Boccioni 1882-1916  Italian Futurist

An exhibition of his work alongside the paintings of artists who influenced him: Severini, Picasso, Carra.

. . .It is easy to see\\
The influence of Seurat . . .

Dabs of unblended pigment\\
. . . Construct form . . .

. . . Like the Fauves, harsh\\
Bright 'beastly' colors

Rendered in\\
`Divisionist notation':

Swarming\\
Brushstrokes magnetized

In shockwave pulses\\
`Express the vortex . . .'

`A life of steel \& fever' urged\\
The self-declared madmen

`Pride \& headlong speed. . .'\\
`The materiality of bodies

`Destroyed by motion \& light.'

                                As we hover\\
At the margins of the attentive\\
Tour, their guide, the man

With sharp temples \& narrow hands\\
Narrates in rapid Italian:      you\\
Alternately follow \& translate, splinter

His lecture but construe the sense:\\
The helixes of meaning that pattern\\
His speech now patternless

How we see: dabs of color,   `beastly,'\\
Swarming,     construct     yet shiver\\
And destroy the material body.
