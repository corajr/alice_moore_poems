\settowidth{\versewidth}{Mist lifts in slow spirals from the canals.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{3\vgap} Is cold.

White drizzle shrouds Santa Lucia, white\\
Mist lifts in slow spirals from the canals.

How shocking, finally, to see you,\\
Raveling mist lifting from you,

As you stand---unmoving, hands\\
Half-raised---not

Smiling, not speaking\\
But stand, hands

Half-raised, just where\\
Just how

I would have imagined you\\
To be, if your being

Depended\\
On me.
\end{verse}
