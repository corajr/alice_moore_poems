\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                          Like\\
                 Lightning\\
Frozen, forked\\
                 Over our heads

---Mid-leap---\\
           Baryshnikov\\
                 Cleaves the air:\\
     In motion

Motionless\\
Doubled \& re-\\
Doubled in plastered\\
Dozens

On brick \& plywood\\
Barrier---\\
                Quicksilver\\
            Genius, the glittering city his

Sequined costume, eyes\\
         Blurred with kohl---\\
               Instantaneous\\
Flight \& plunge

            Suspended\\
He vanishes---\\
                            And we\\
Turn \& climb iron

Stairs into the iron-\\
Girded world\\
With wings\\
At our heels.
