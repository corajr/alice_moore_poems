\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
In Calais, the rain comes down. As we pull out,\\
It drums steadily on the train windows\\
---A rhythm, a pattern---words, almost---\\
A surreal complaint, verging on reason.

Outside Calais, the French countryside rolls\\
Low hills, rounded as if a gentle hand\\
Smoothed them, past the window.   Rain spangles the glass.\\
The glyphic chatter of the other passengers

Washes over me---but the rain, whispering\\
In its own tongue, begins to penetrate\\
Past consciousness: it is a tongue I begin\\
To remember.  The grey sky falls through

Indigo to purple. When I arrive, night\\
Has crested over the medieval city\\
\hspace*{2\vgap} Of Paris.
\end{verse}
