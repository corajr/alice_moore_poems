\settowidth{\versewidth}{Streetlight etches the edges of objects---}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
For a month, no footfall, no\\
Motion of my body eddies the air,

The dust where it floats\\
In slatted sunlight.

Perhaps the phone rings---\\
And rings---

And rings---\& rings---\& rings.\\
Perhaps, thousands of miles east,

On a fog-eaten January afternoon,\\
My train pulls into Venice.

Rectangles, oblongs, trapezoids---\\
Unnameable shapes: light cut

By crossbars, branches, the flight\\
Of birds in dozens, the movement

Of the sun overhead, east\\
To west, day upon day.

And at night, the death-\\
Like stillness, darkness

Not absolute: muted\\
Streetlight etches the edges of objects---

The rest falls away into gloom.\\
Finally, at the center of everything---

Light \& dark, the dark \& light\\
Rotation of day into night, night

Breaking at dawn---\\
In my studio, a drawing

Arrested---tentative\\
Yet unchanging---the

Unfinished\\
Mysterious

Evolving face\\
Of a woman two years dead.

I will return to her: it is she\\
Who will never return.
\end{verse}
