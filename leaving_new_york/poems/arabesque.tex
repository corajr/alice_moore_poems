\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
At the same moment in England\\
It is an hour earlier: Mark and Sarah\\
Still asleep in Fulham, a bluish vapor

Hanging in the window, wreathing\\
The rows of pale winter cabbages in the garden.\\
Inching across France, the day

Pauses for a moment\\
At the Channel, advancing\\
Slowly westward over churning grey seas.

And in the States, it is midnight\\
Now: Wednesday just pirouetting\\
Into Thursday, my friends

Honeycombed with dreams,\\
Encapsulated in sleep, dark, distance,\\
Silence.   I want to ask them questions,

Very simple questions,\\
But they go on sleeping, unhearing,\\
As the train carries me further

\hspace*{3\vgap} Away\\
\hspace*{4\vgap} East.
\end{verse}
