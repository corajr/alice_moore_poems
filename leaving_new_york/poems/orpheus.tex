\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{4\vgap} A man

In a pork-pie hat \qquad red-checkered\\*
Shirt \qquad checkered pants \qquad smiles\\*
And gives us directions: \qquad \textit{There---\\*
Follow the red arrows \qquad a tunnel \qquad a ramp\\*
Black iron gates\\*
You're there.}

The floor of the Port Authority\\*
Angles toward the surface: ten doors\\*
Face ten doors\\*
Across the waiting area---\\*
Beyond, buses glisten\\*
Like silver grubs in thick soil. \qquad You\\*
Have been singing in your native Italian

A star-lit Italian love song insisting\\*
It is happy, ecstatic: to me it sounds sad.\\*
But the stone-faced people in line with us\\*
Shiver, suddenly\\*
Aware of their surroundings---of you,\\*
Singing\\*
As if you were

Somewhere else.\\*
You turn to me.\\*
Quickly\\*
We kiss, glancing\\*
Away from each other. \qquad \textit{Ciao!}\\*
As I hand my ticket to the driver I know\\*
I must not turn to see

You.
\end{verse}
