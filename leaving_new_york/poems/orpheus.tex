\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                                                A man

In a pork-pie hat     red-checkered\\
Shirt     checkered pants    smiles\\
And gives us directions:      There---\\
Follow the red arrows     a tunnel    a ramp\\
Black iron gates\\
You're there.

The floor of the Port Authority\\
Angles toward the surface: ten doors\\
Face ten doors\\
Across the waiting area---\\
Beyond, buses glisten\\
Like silver grubs in thick soil.     You\\
Have been singing in your native Italian

A star-lit Italian love song   insisting\\
It is happy, ecstatic: to me it sounds sad.\\
But the stone-faced people in line with us\\
Shiver, suddenly\\
Aware of their surroundings---of you,\\
Singing\\
As if you were

Somewhere else.\\
You turn to me.\\
Quickly\\
We kiss, glancing\\
Away from each other.     Ciao!\\
As I hand my ticket to the driver I know\\
I must not turn to see

You.
\end{verse}
