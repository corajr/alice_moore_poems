\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Framed by my red umbrella,\\
Boston Harbor at ebb tide---\\
A slab of basalt tipping \& swelling\\
Against the concrete sea-wall---\\
                                                       The sky\\
Grey \& roughened like the bottom of a boat.\\
We had spent\\
Most of the afternoon in\\
And out of every music store\\
                                                       Between\\
Park Square \& Berklee, searching\\
For ``The Real Book,'' ending up\\
Late, almost too late,\\
At the Aquarium.     Inside\\
                                                        The rain,\\
The monster-laden ocean,\\
Are inaudible---the blue-green\\
Tanks, arranged in grids,\\
Rise into darkness.\\
                                                        Gazing\\
Past the labeled glass, we\\
Whisper or say nothing, imagining---\\
 Zleeeeeeeee!   Bubbles in our ears\\
A clean dive---\\
                           Silence\\
Rippling over the slippery neon shoals.
