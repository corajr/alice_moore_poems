\settowidth{\versewidth}{Tangled skein of yarn on her fingersâ€”}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The garage walls \& ceiling\\*
Are dark contours lost in darkness\\*
Until the cavernous portal\\*
Fills with harsh sunlight

As it opens on rubbish-\\*
Strewn streets.     Outside,\\*
Propped against a cinderblock wall,\\*
Seated on a crate, pale

Amid pale thorny weeds,\\*
A bag lady nods in her visions,\\*
Tangled skein of yarn on her fingers---\\*
While on the wall a corroded mural

---A relic of the sixties---\\*
Flames over her head.
\end{verse}
