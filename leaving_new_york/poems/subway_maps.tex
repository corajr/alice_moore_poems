\settowidth{\versewidth}{Tube. It finally spits me—\& my luggage—out}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Victoria Station is grey\\*
And black \& a multitude\\*
Of colors that add up to no color.

Nothing is open yet.   No one is around,\\*
And those solitary travelers that appear\\*
Are dazed, private, pulled into themselves

Like snails.   It's a cool clear\\*
Sunday morning.  Aqua, green,\\*
Red, navy, yellow, black

Tracks: the subway map looks simple\\*
But doesn't make any sense.\\*
The man in the ticket office explains,

In a thick accent, what I must do.\\*
He's speaking English.\\*
I'm speaking English.

It's impossible for me to say just\\*
What, exactly, I don't understand.\\*
I walk away, trying to fit

His words to my colorful map.\\*
The subway---the Tube---is not painted\\*
Like the map.\qquad Subways

Never are. The T,\\*
The MTA, the Tube: a subway\\*
Is a subway is a subway is a

Tube. It finally spits me---\& my luggage---out\\*
At Parson's Green, which is grey,\\*
And I wait for Mark \& Sarah to arrive:

They are friends, they will make\\*
Sense. It's 3 a.m.\\*
---Not here, but in the States---

Where I am scouring my empty\\*
Apartment, the familiar alphabet\\*
Of my friends, my routine, the unfinished

Drawing in my studio, for some\\*
Thing, some series of\\*
Things, some rhythm or pattern that

Will order---no---harmonize---these\\*
Fragments, this\\*
New knowledge.
\end{verse}
