\settowidth{\versewidth}{Above the closed shops.\qquad\qquad His touch}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                             Orion\\
Straddles the rooftops.   The steamy night air

Is sweet\\
With the odor of

Rain that does not\\
Fall.

At three in the morning the streets are finally cool\\
And the meditative voice of a solo saxophone

Cascades from an open window high\\
Above the closed shops.                      His touch

Is like the grip of those half-\\
Remembered streets

Upon my imagination\\
Or like

The wash\\
Of ambient

Moonlight\\
Upon these deserted park benches.

Orion's\\
Head

Turns from the horizon\\
He is

Listening:\\
Hunter

Lover\\
Myth.
\end{verse}
