\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The station was grimy \& cavernous:\\*
The long black trains---

Polished---\\*
Monumental---

Lined up, perfectly parallel,\\*
Along successive tracks.

Their very darkness,\\*
Their stillness,

Seemed evidence of their imminent\\*
Awakening---

Then the long\\*
Glide out of the city, south

Toward Switzerland \& Italy.
\end{verse}
