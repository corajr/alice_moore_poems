\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
. . . .The 'Library' and to its right\\
The entrance to the Campanille. . . .\\
Nineteenth century\\
Architectural still: the Piazza\\
San Marco, Venice.

With a pen that keeps skipping\\
You've written your address\\
In blue ink\\
Scratched a rough sketch: gondola,\\
Gondolier exclaiming HALLO!

Beyond is the Grand Canal---\\
Yet beyond you see. . . .\\
I see.     Your bacarole\\
Is lost on the vast expanse:\\
The water is white paper.
\end{verse}
