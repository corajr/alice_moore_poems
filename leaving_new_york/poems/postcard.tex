\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\ldots\textit{The `Library' and to its right\\
The entrance to the Campanille}\ldots\\
Nineteenth century\\
Architectural still: the Piazza\\
San Marco, Venice.

With a pen that keeps skipping\\
You've written your address\\
In blue ink\\
Scratched a rough sketch: gondola,\\
Gondolier exclaiming \textit{HALLO!}

\textit{Beyond is the Grand Canal---\\
Yet beyond you see}\ldots\\
I see. Your bacarole\\
Is lost on the vast expanse:\\
The water is white paper.
\end{verse}
