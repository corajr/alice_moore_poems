\settowidth{\versewidth}{Hundred miles distantâ€”Northampton.  The empty rural night}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
You sing. And we wander the Village\\
11 o'clock at night, the slicked streets\\
Glary \& blaring, the traffic sporadic.\\
What is it I can't tell you\\
By making love to you? An American woman,\\
Singing in your ear, her tongue drawing cool\\
Air across the ravening nerve.   You sing,

Laughing, at the piano bar:\\
You know the gaudy American show tunes\\
Word for word. Later there will be the spacious\\
Silence of the cramped hotel room.\\
But we're not there yet.   And we've left---one, two\\
Hundred miles distant---Northampton.  The empty rural night\\
Here is mazed with canyoned streets.

All is steep and narrow.   No,\\
I can't sing, I can't catch the tune.\\
You sing.  Sing, pretend\\
You're Pavarotti or Armstrong.   Or Jarreau:\\
And love is like a stranger,\\
He's running\\
Out\\
Of things to say. . . .
\end{verse}
