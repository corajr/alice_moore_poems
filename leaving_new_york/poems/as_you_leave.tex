\PoemTitle{As You Leave}
\label{ch:as_you_leave}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{The air over the black Atlantic}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I am a spectator

Alongside friends\\
I empty myself of thought:

I watch \& listen:\\
Sonny Rollins

In his floppy\\
Red satin hat

Sways \& cat-\\
Like paces

The slender ribbon\\
Of light

Of melody\\
The very thought---

Center stage\\
Solo Cadenza

On his sleek\\
Mm!

The very thought of you!\\
Silver-gold sax

Burnished\\
Gold sax

Red hat\\
Black

Fabulous\\
Air

Audience\\
Sequined like a party dress

Or the constellations\\
Of New York City

Glittering\\
Beneath your jet as it arcs

Out of La Guardia\\
Slashing

The air over the black Atlantic\\
In two.
\end{verse}
