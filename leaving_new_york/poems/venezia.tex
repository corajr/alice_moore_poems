\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
               Is the only light

Source for this photograph:\\
Light reflected up from the canal

Through the kitchen window.     There\\
In the shadow by the stove

Is my crescent-moon profile,\\
The tilt of my body against the sill,

And around my lips \& eyes\\
The wrinkles

Of incipient laughter\\
About to splinter

Your careful composition\\
---The moment---

                               Into\\
Smithereens.
\end{verse}
