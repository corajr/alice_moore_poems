\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
                      More softly\\
Now, you sing.   And we stroll the fairytale\\
Stone forest: carved buttresses \& spires, the top\\
Of the Duomo.    Four thousand saints\\
Balance on the spires: you grow dizzy,\\
Imagining yourself in place of one-hundred\\
Of that precipitous company: you sink

On my arm, then recover: some soldier!\\
We both laugh.   There is one night left:\\
It globes over us, a new world, still\\
To be known.   Inside the cathedral,\\
The colors of the stained glass---blood red,\\
Midnight-blue, drenched yellow, fire-green, marine\\
Purple---become for us the spectrum

Of a pure world, a world of absolute\\
Love, rage, sadness. A child's palette, but emblazoned\\
With the blood of saints \& demons.\\
When we emerge, it is dusk.   Traffic circles\\
The plaza: red \& white lights---like coals\\
Or torches---glide past in transient pagentry.\\
We watch silently.    In love with you,

Your lover, I ask\\
Myself: What is it I have told you\\
By making love with you?
\end{verse}
