\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Monet's figures dissolve in light:\\
Light obscures them.\\
Especially the faces: there's almost\\
Nothing: each eye a dark stroke, the mouth

Rose---or blue: wife or son or mistress or second\\
Wife---they're all the same, all\\
Insubstantial as light.    Dark\\
With excessive bright

They disappear.
\end{verse}
