\PoemTitle{Northampton / New York / Boston}
\label{ch:northampton}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{We might stop, and we do not want}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Which city was it? I remember\\*
Fragments. The back of the cab\\*
Is dark. You slide

Close. We stop saying\\*
Much of anything.\\*
The winter street we cross

Deep blue with dusk, the moon\\*
A child's face by Klee, wise,\\*
Solemn, silent. Like us.

We do not look behind.\\*
We try not to look\\*
Ahead. If we did

We might stop, and we do not want\\*
That. I know\\*
You, foreign

As you are, foreign\\*
As I am, the whole\\*
Territory of my body

New.\\*
You are a man.\\*
You are a boy.

You are my double: the same\\*
Height, the same\\*
Changeable green eyes,

The same ocean\\*
Separating us\\*
As it will.
\end{verse}
