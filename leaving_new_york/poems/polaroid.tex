\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
We've just left the museum---we walk\\*
Across Central Park, the grass\\*
Green as the hair of barbarians.\\*
Red, blue, \& white litter

Cartwheels across our path, the jig-sawed\\*
Leaves overhead throw jig-sawed light\\*
And shadow on our faces, the wind\\*
Whips a crazy strobe, the sudden glare

Renders us\\*
Fuchsia   cyan   yellow   black   a stranger\\*
Holds the camera     we stand\\*
Still: the mosaic

Stills---registers on the light-\\*
Sensitive film: here\\*
It is is: stilled Fauve photograph\\*
Here it is: there

We were there we\\*
Are: the two of us\\*
Framed\\*
Under a chromium sun.
\end{verse}
