\settowidth{\versewidth}{But on a black winter morning in Massachusetts,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\textit{All in a single night could change.}

Now\\*
As I write this

You are still in New York\\*
\textit{Mio amor}\ldots The only Italian I know

Is cadged from opera\\*
And even that I make quick hash of---\\*
\ldots \textit{Come il mare profunda et infinita}: now\\*
You are asleep, six miles

Above the formless Atlantic.\\*
But on a black winter morning in Massachusetts,

As I write Now,\\*
You are in Venice

And it is almost\\*
Noon. \textit{Venezia, o cara}

\textit{Noi lasceremo}: not quite\\*
Puccini's words but

No one is listening\\*
As I dice up Verdi as well:

\textit{L'ora fuggita}:\\*
The hours flee?  

\textit{Fuggiam da questa mura}:\\*
Let us flee these walls, flee

Venice, Paris, the confines\\*
Of time itself: opera

Proposes its tombs \& heavens,\\*
Its immortal loves,

And provides---\\*
For me---

A fractured vocabulary\\*
To embroider the hours with.

\textit{E tutto un sol}---\\*
What is the Italian

For night? \textit{All\\*
In a single night could change}. But

For now sun, moon, constellations\\*
Move over us

From divergent angles \qquad you\\*
Always six hours ahead\qquad I

Trailing, imagining, gazing\\*
Ahead as memories

Kaleidoscope\\*
Before \& after.
\end{verse}
