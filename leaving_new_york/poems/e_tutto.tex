\settowidth{\versewidth}{But on a black winter morning in Massachusetts,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
All in a single night could change.

Now\\
As I write this

You are still in New York\\
Mio amor. . . . The only Italian I know

Is cadged from opera\\
And even that I make quick hash of---\\
. . . . Come il mare profunda et infinita: now\\
You are asleep, six miles

Above the formless Atlantic.\\
But on a black winter morning in Massachusetts,

As I write Now,\\
You are in Venice

And it is almost\\
Noon.   Venezia, o cara

Noi lasceremo: not quite\\
Puccini's words but

No one is listening\\
As I dice up Verdi as well:

L'ora fuggita:\\
The hours flee?  

Fuggiam da questa mura:\\
Let us flee these walls, flee

Venice, Paris, the confines\\
Of time itself: opera

Proposes its tombs \& heavens,\\
Its immortal loves,

And provides---\\
For me---

A fractured vocabulary\\
To embroider the hours with.

E tutto un sol---\\
What is the Italian

For night? All\\
In a single night could change. But

For now sun, moon, constellations\\
Move over us

From divergent angles   you\\
Always six hours ahead   I

Trailing, imagining, gazing\\
Ahead as memories

Kaleidescope\\
Before \& after.
\end{verse}
