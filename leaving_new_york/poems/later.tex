\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
At the Aquarium\\
The film about\\
Whales slips

From the sprockets\\
Stutters in place\\
Like a volley of\\
harbor\\
Subway\\
Cars\\
Flashing

A hundred faces in

One\\
Blurred\\
Window.

The dolphins\\
In their wet

Sexual arcs\\
Are caught

Again---ah!   \& again\\
In the flash of instamatics

Mmmmmmmmmmm. . .\\
Descending in slow

Motion\\
Ahhhhhhh!

Beautiful!\\
The crowd begins to sweat---ah!

Beautiful as the blade of a knife!\\
Cleaving the ocean in two---
\end{verse}
