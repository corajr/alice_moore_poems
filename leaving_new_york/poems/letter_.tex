\textit{This is the photo of us I prefer!}

You've scrawled on the back\\
---Your face is blurred, you look older.    

\hspace*{3\vgap} I\\
Am

Struggling to keep the black\\
Cat in the frame---I look up

Just in time to see my sister\\
Snap \qquad the picture \qquad I

Appear oddly\\
Composed. \qquad Now

Here it is:\\
Three months later

The photo arrives, enclosed\\
In one of your translucent letters

The steely net of sentences\\
Lacing both sides of the air

Mail sheet, the paper so thin---\\
So thin, words

Penned on one side are\\
Visible---

Illegible\\
Palimpsest---

On the reverse.\\
These are signs:

The inflections of light \& color,\\
The lilt, the deepening

Of your voice, even\\
In memory---

It's OK, I\\
Understand.
\end{verse}
