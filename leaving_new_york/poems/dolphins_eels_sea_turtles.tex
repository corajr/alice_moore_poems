\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\hspace*{1\vgap} On the wall of the subway station:\\*
Wall-sized outlines\\*
Drawn white on indigo.\\*
Larger than life.\\*
Hovering

On the wall at our backs\\*
So that while we wait---\\*
While we wait for the train\\*
And peer down the dark\\*
Tunnel \& listen---

There is the rumbling promise of a train\\*
---No---it's above us, or below---\\*
While we wait, our minds wander\\*
Over the surface of reality:\\*
The crowd---pick-pockets---the time---

The babble towering at the edge\\*
Of consciousness---\\*
And simultaneously we begin\\*
To wonder\\*
If Jonah was really

Swallowed by a whale---\\*
Do dolphins rescue\\*
Drowning sailors?     What if\\*
All those shark stories\\*
Are true?
\end{verse}
