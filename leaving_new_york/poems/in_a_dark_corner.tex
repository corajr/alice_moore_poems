\PoemTitle{In A Dark Corner}
\label{ch:in_a_dark_corner}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{As we step into a subway car or through}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
As the fish---(the\\
Saw-toothed barracuda, primeval\\
Shark---the dolphin we think\\
An Other aspect of ourselves)

---As the fish approaches the dawn beach,\\
Land \& air\\
The fish's body forks\\
Or takes on wings---Or

As we step into a subway car or through\\
The bars of light \& shadow cast\\
Across our path in Central Park---\\
Or as I roll toward you in bed

My body forks: there it is:\\
A new species         (in\\
The window above the bed, light\\
Scales the brick wall in the alley).
\end{verse}
